    "\n",
    "In this session, we will be acquiring the letters that we will use over the course of this workshop. We will be using the letters of Robert Louis Stevenson, made available through Wikisource in two volumes ([Vol 1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Letters_of_Robert_Louis_Stevenson_Volume_1) & [Vol 2](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Letters_of_Robert_Louis_Stevenson_Volume_2)). In this case, since there are only twelve pages that we need to download, we can just download the pages manually by saving each page in our browsers. At larger scales, you may consider using a command line utility like wget (for which there is a [tutorial on The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/automated-downloading-with-wget)), or with some additional Python (which also has a tutorial on [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/downloading-multiple-records-using-query-strings))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are using a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), which is a tool for interactive programming with the Python programming language. The notebook consists of a series of \"cells\". Some, like this one, are for taking notes. We call those \"Markdown cells\", because they use the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax. We also have code cells, where we can execute Python code and see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Jupyter Notebook yourself, I recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) Python distribution. Installing Python can be quite a hassle, but using this distribution makes it much easier to get up and running quickly, and includes Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you've never seen Python code before, this session should help you form expectations for what you can do with HTML documents in Python. If you have worked with Python before, or you're interested in learning, you can use this code as an example for your own projects. Since this isn't a \"Learn Python\" workshop, there will be a lot of things that we'll gloss over in the interest of time, but if you're interested in learning Python, I'd recommend saving it and coming back to it in between tutorials to see how much of it you understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "__If you want to pursue learning Python...__\n",
    "\n",
    "While we're going through this tutorial, take advantage of this interactive environment to modify pieces of code, so that you can see if the results are what you expect. Most of programming is learning how to align your expectations with what the code does, and much of that learning process can be done through experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__If you don't...__\n",
    "\n",
    "That's totally fine! Learning to program represents a significant time commitment, which not all of us have. Digital scholarship tends to be collaborative because no individual can master every aspect of the work that goes into it. However, being familiar with how programming works and how programmers have to approach problems can give you better intuitions about the kinds of problems that can be solved with programmatic approaches, and make you a better collaborator on digital scholarship projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "And who knows, you might find programming easier than you think!\n",
    "\n",
    "__In any case...__\n",
    "\n",

    "## Our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at any code, however, let's look at what it is that we actually want to do. The goal is to transform pages on Wikisource that contain many letters into a series of documents, each containing a single letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at a single page ([Volume 1, Chapter 1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Letters_of_Robert_Louis_Stevenson_Volume_1/Chapter_I) for example), and see what kind of useful patterns we might have to work with. Once we have an idea of what we want to do conceptually, we can put that into practice with Python code."

    "|`import csv`|`csv`|Module for working with CSV files, which we will use for output.|\n",
    "|`from lxml import html`|`html`|This command is different because we're not importing an entire module, we're importing a sub-module. `lxml` is a module for interacting with XML and XML-like documents, and `html` is a sub-module specifically for working with HTML documents|"

When you're opening a file on your computer, you open it the same way whether you want to look at it or edit it. In Python, opening a file for reading and writing are different, and there are even different kinds of writing, depending on whether you're making a new file or adding to an existing file. \n",

We could create the file with `writer = csv.writer(fp)`, which uses default options for writing to a CSV file. Instead, we've also specified that we want to put quotes around every field. Since CSV files are just text that use commas to indicate fields, sometimes CSV files that include text get their cells split unintentionally by commas in the text. However, quotation marks around text serve as more solid boundaries for the cells, ensuring that our CSV works as expected. So, we've specified that we want quotation marks around all of our cells with the option `quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL`. There's a lot to get used to, and it takes time, but if you've ever opened a spreadsheet to find that the contents are all split up or made up of crazy characters, you'll appreciate being able to ensure that that doesn't happen.\n",

    "$\\uparrow$ That long line of code inside those square brackets is called a \"list comprehension\", and it's one of the cool features of Python. Essentially, it's a way of creating a new list by iterating through another list and performing some functions without creating a full-on loop. It's really handy when you want to perform one quick function, or if you want to filter a list, like we do. \n",

    "[f$^1$ for f in$^2$ os.listdir('wikisource')$^3$ if$^4$ os.path.isfile(\"wikisource/\"+f)$^5$ and f != 'Icon\\r'$^6$]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `f` is just the name of the variable that we're using to represent every item in the list, like we did with the `for` loop earlier. If we were making modifications to the list items, this is where we would do it. For example, if we had a list of numbers, we could put `f*2` here instead, to multiply every number by two.\n",
    "2. `for f in ...` is the main syntax for a list comprehension. `[x*2 for x in list]` is a really simple list comprehension that multiplies everything in a list by two. It tells you what variable name it will use as a stand in for list items, and which list it's using as the basis of the list comprehension.\n",
    "3. Since `os.listdir('wikisource')` returns a list, we can use it like one without creating a variable for it and giving it its own name.\n",
    "4. The `if` is an optional part of the list comprehension, that puts conditions on which list items to include in the output list. The items will only be transformed and added to the new list if they pass those tests.\n",
    "5. First we check if our location is a file. We have to put \"`wikisource/`\" in front of the file name, since `os.listdir()` just returns names, not whole paths.\n",
    "6. We have an additional test for list items, and the item must pass both to be included because we've connected the two conditions with `and`. This test is just to eliminate that pesky Icon file.\n",
