<p>Letter: TO PROFESSOR AENEAS MACKAY</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, PERTHSHIRE [JUNE 1881].</p>
<p>MY DEAR MACKAY, - Thank you very much for your kind letter, and still more for your good opinion. You are not the only one who has regretted my absence from your lectures; but you were to me, then, only a part of a mangle through which I was being slowly and unwillingly dragged - part of a course which I had not chosen - part, in a word, of an organised boredom.</p>
<p>I am glad to have your reasons for giving up the chair; they are partly pleasant, and partly honourable to you. And I think one may say that every man who publicly declines a plurality of offices, makes it perceptibly more difficult for the next man to accept them.</p>
<p>Every one tells me that I come too late upon the field, every one being pledged, which, seeing it is yet too early for any one to come upon the field, I must regard as a polite evasion. Yet all advise me to stand, as it might serve me against the next vacancy. So stand I shall, unless things are changed. As it is, with my health this summer class is a great attraction; it is perhaps the only hope I may have of a permanent income. I had supposed the needs of the chair might be met by choosing every year some period of history in which questions of Constitutional Law were involved; but this is to look too far forward.</p>
<p>I understand (1ST) that no overt steps can be taken till your resignation is accepted; and (2ND) that in the meantime I may, without offence, mention my design to stand.</p>
<p>If I am mistaken about these, please correct me, as I do not wish to appear where I should not.</p>
<p>Again thanking you very heartily for your coals of fire I remain yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
