<p>Letter: TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>HOTEL DU VAL DE GRACE, RUE ST. JACQUES, PARIS, SUNDAY [JUNE 1878].</p>
<p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - About criticisms, I was more surprised at the tone of the critics than I suppose any one else. And the effect it has produced in me is one of shame. If they liked that so much, I ought to have given them something better, that's all. And I shall try to do so. Still, it strikes me as odd; and I don't understand the vogue. It should sell the thing. - Ever your affectionate son,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
