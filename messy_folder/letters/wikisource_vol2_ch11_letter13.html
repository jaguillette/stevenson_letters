<p><b>Letter: TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA [SUMMER 1891].</p>
<p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - I find among my grandfather's papers his own reminiscences of his voyage round the north with Sir Walter, eighty years ago, LABUNTUR ANNI! They are not remarkably good, but he was not a bad observer, and several touches seem to me speaking. It has occurred to me you might like them to appear in the MAGAZINE. If you would, kindly let me know, and tell me how you would like it handled. My grandad's MS. runs to between six and seven thousand words, which I could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch Sir W. Would you like this done? Would you like me to introduce the old gentleman? I had something of the sort in my mind, and could fill a few columns rather A PROPOS. I give you the first offer of this, according to your request; for though it may forestall one of the interests of my biography, the thing seems to me particularly suited for prior appearance in a magazine.</p>
<p>I see the first number of the WRECKER; I thought it went lively enough; and by a singular accident, the picture is not unlike Tai- o-hae!</p>
<p>Thus we see the age of miracles, etc. - Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
<p>Proofs for next mail.</p>
