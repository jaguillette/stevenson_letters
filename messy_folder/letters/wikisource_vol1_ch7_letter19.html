<p>Letter: TO SIDNEY COLVIN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BONALLIE TOWERS, BRANKSOME PARK, BOURNEMOUTH, JAN. 4, 1885.</p>
<p>DEAR S. C., - I am on my feet again, and getting on my boots to do the IRON DUKE. Conceive my glee: I have refused the 100 pounds, and am to get some sort of royalty, not yet decided, instead. 'Tis for Longman's ENGLISH WORTHIES, edited by A. Lang. Aw haw, haw!</p>
<p>Now, look here, could you get me a loan of the Despatches, or is that a dream? I should have to mark passages I fear, and certainly note pages on the fly. If you think it a dream, will Bain get me a second-hand copy, or who would? The sooner, and cheaper, I can get it the better. If there is anything in your weird library that bears on either the man or the period, put it in a mortar and fire it here instanter; I shall catch. I shall want, of course, an infinity of books: among which, any lives there may be; a life of the Marquis Marmont (the Marechal), MARMONT'S MEMOIRS, GREVILLE'S MEMOIRS, PEEL'S MEMOIRS, NAPIER, that blind man's history of England you once lent me, Hamley's WATERLOO; can you get me any of these? Thiers, idle Thiers also. Can you help a man getting into his boots for such a huge campaign? How are you? A Good New Year to you. I mean to have a good one, but on whose funds I cannot fancy: not mine leastways, as I am a mere derelict and drift beam- on to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>For God's sake, remember the man who set out for to conquer Arthur Wellesley, with a broken bellows and an empty pocket. - Yours ever,</p>
<p>R. L. STEVENSON.</p>
