<p>Letter: 2 SULYARDE TERRACE, TORQUAY, THURSDAY (APRIL 1866).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>RESPECTED PATERNAL RELATIVE, - I write to make a request of the most moderate nature. Every year I have cost you an enormous - nay, elephantine - sum of money for drugs and physician's fees, and the most expensive time of the twelve months was March.</p>
<p>But this year the biting Oriental blasts, the howling tempests, and the general ailments of the human race have been successfully braved by yours truly.</p>
<p>Does not this deserve remuneration?</p>
<p>I appeal to your charity, I appeal to your generosity, I appeal to your justice, I appeal to your accounts, I appeal, in fine, to your purse.</p>
<p>My sense of generosity forbids the receipt of more - my sense of justice forbids the receipt of less - than half-a-crown. - Greeting from, Sir, your most affectionate and needy son,</p>
<p>R. STEVENSON.</p>
