<p>Letter: TO SIDNEY COLVIN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[EDINBURGH, FEBRUARY 1876.]</p>
<p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - 1ST. I have sent 'Fontainebleau' long ago, long ago. And Leslie Stephen is worse than tepid about it - liked 'some parts' of it 'very well,' the son of Belial. Moreover, he proposes to shorten it; and I, who want MONEY, and money soon, and not glory and the illustration of the English language, I feel as if my poverty were going to consent.</p>
<p>2ND. I'm as fit as a fiddle after my walk. I am four inches bigger about the waist than last July! There, that's your prophecy did that. I am on 'Charles of Orleans' now, but I don't know where to send him. Stephen obviously spews me out of his mouth, and I spew him out of mine, so help me! A man who doesn't like my 'Fontainebleau'! His head must be turned.</p>
<p>3RD. If ever you do come across my 'Spring' (I beg your pardon for referring to it again, but I don't want you to forget) send it off at once.</p>
<p>4TH. I went to Ayr, Maybole, Girvan, Ballantrae, Stranraer, Glenluce, and Wigton. I shall make an article of it some day soon, 'A Winter's Walk in Carrick and Galloway.' I had a good time. - Yours,</p>
<p>R. L S.</p>
