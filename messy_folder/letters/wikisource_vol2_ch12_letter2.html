<p><b>Letter: TO A. CONAN DOYLE</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, APIA, SAMOA, APRIL 5TH, 1893.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, - You have taken many occasions to make yourself very agreeable to me, for which I might in decency have thanked you earlier. It is now my turn; and I hope you will allow me to offer you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes. That is the class of literature that I like when I have the toothache. As a matter of fact, it was a pleurisy I was enjoying when I took the volume up; and it will interest you as a medical man to know that the cure was for the moment effectual. Only the one thing troubles me: can this be my old friend Joe Bell? - I am, yours very truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>P.S. - And lo, here is your address supplied me here in Samoa! But do not take mine, O frolic fellow Spookist, from the same source; mine is wrong.</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
