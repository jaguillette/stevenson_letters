<p>Letter: TO H. A. JONES</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BONALLIE TOWERS, BRANKSOME PARK, BOURNEMOUTH, DEC. 30, 1884.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, - I am so accustomed to hear nonsense spoken about all the arts, and the drama in particular, that I cannot refrain from saying 'Thank you,' for your paper. In my answer to Mr. James, in the December LONGMAN, you may see that I have merely touched, I think in a parenthesis, on the drama; but I believe enough was said to indicate our agreement in essentials.</p>
<p>Wishing you power and health to further enunciate and to act upon these principles, believe me, dear sir, yours truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
