Letter: TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[CHEZ SIRON, BARBIZON, SEINE ET MARNE, AUGUST 1875.]</p>
<p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I have been three days at a place called Grez, a pretty and very melancholy village on the plain. A low bridge of many arches choked with sedge; great fields of white and yellow water-lilies; poplars and willows innumerable; and about it all such an atmosphere of sadness and slackness, one could do nothing but get into the boat and out of it again, and yawn for bedtime.</p>
<p>Yesterday Bob and I walked home; it came on a very creditable thunderstorm; we were soon wet through; sometimes the rain was so heavy that one could only see by holding the hand over the eyes; and to crown all, we lost our way and wandered all over the place, and into the artillery range, among broken trees, with big shot lying about among the rocks. It was near dinner-time when we got to Barbizon; and it is supposed that we walked from twenty-three to twenty-five miles, which is not bad for the Advocate, who is not tired this morning. I was very glad to be back again in this dear place, and smell the wet forest in the morning.</p>
<p>Simpson and the rest drove back in a carriage, and got about as wet as we did.</p>
<p>Why don't you write? I have no more to say. - Ever your affectionate son,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
