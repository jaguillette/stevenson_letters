<p><b>Letter: TO THE COUNTESS OF JERSEY</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>AUGUST 14, 1745.</p>
<p>TO MISS AMELIA BALFOUR - MY DEAR COUSIN, - We are going an expedition to leeward on Tuesday morning. If a lady were perhaps to be encountered on horseback - say, towards the Gasi-gasi river - about six A.M., I think we should have an episode somewhat after the style of the '45. What a misfortune, my dear cousin, that you should have arrived while your cousin Graham was occupying my only guest-chamber - for Osterley Park is not so large in Samoa as it was at home - but happily our friend Haggard has found a corner for you!</p>
<p>The King over the Water - the Gasi-gasi water - will be pleased to see the clan of Balfour mustering so thick around his standard.</p>
<p>I have (one serious word) been so lucky as to get a really secret interpreter, so all is for the best in our little adventure into the WAVERLEY NOVELS. - I am your affectionate cousin,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>Observe the stealth with which I have blotted my signature, but we must be political A OUTRANCE.</p>
