<p><b>Letter: TO SIR HERBERT MAXWELL</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, SEPTEMBER 10, 1894.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR HERBERT MAXWELL, - I am emboldened by reading your very interesting Rhind Lectures to put to you a question: What is my name, Stevenson?</p>
<p>I find it in the forms Stevinetoun, Stevensoune, Stevensonne, Stenesone, Stewinsoune, M'Stein, and MacStephane. My family, and (as far as I can gather) the majority of the inglorious clan, hailed from the borders of Cunningham and Renfrew, and the upper waters of the Clyde. In the Barony of Bothwell was the seat of the laird Stevenson of Stevenson; but, as of course you know, there is a parish in Cunningham and places in Peebles and Haddington bearing the same name.</p>
<p>If you can at all help me, you will render me a real service which I wish I could think of some manner to repay. - Believe me, yours truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>P.S. - I should have added that I have perfect evidence before me that (for some obscure reason) Stevenson was a favourite alias with the M'Gregors.</p>
