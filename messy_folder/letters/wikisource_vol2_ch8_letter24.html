<p>BRITISH MUSEUM [AUGUST 10TH, 1886].</p>
<p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - We are having a capital holiday, and I am much better, and enjoying myself to the nines. Richmond is painting my portrait. To-day I lunch with him, and meet Burne-Jones; to-night Browning dines with us. That sounds rather lofty work, does it not? His path was paved with celebrities. To-morrow we leave for Paris, and next week, I suppose, or the week after, come home. Address here, as we may not reach Paris. I am really very well. - Ever your affectionate son,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
