<p>THE COTTAGE (LATE THE LATE MISS M'GREGOR'S), CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR, AUGUST 10, 1881.</p>
<p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Come on the 24th, there is a dear fellow. Everybody else wants to come later, and it will be a godsend for, sir - Yours sincerely.</p>
<p>You can stay as long as you behave decently, and are not sick of, sir - Your obedient, humble servant.</p>
<p>We have family worship in the home of, sir - Yours respectfully.</p>
<p>Braemar is a fine country, but nothing to (what you will also see) the maps of, sir - Yours in the Lord.</p>
<p>A carriage and two spanking hacks draw up daily at the hour of two before the house of, sir - Yours truly.</p>
<p>The rain rains and the winds do beat upon the cottage of the late Miss Macgregor and of, sir - Yours affectionately.</p>
<p>It is to be trusted that the weather may improve ere you know the halls of, sir - Yours emphatically.</p>
<p>All will be glad to welcome you, not excepting, sir - Yours ever.</p>
<p>You will now have gathered the lamentable intellectual collapse of, sir - Yours indeed.</p>
<p>And nothing remains for me but to sign myself, sir - Yours,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>N.B. - Each of these clauses has to be read with extreme glibness, coming down whack upon the 'Sir.' This is very important. The fine stylistic inspiration will else be lost.</p>
<p>I commit the man who made, the man who sold, and the woman who supplied me with my present excruciating gilt nib to that place where the worm never dies.</p>
<p>The reference to a deceased Highland lady (tending as it does to foster unavailing sorrow) may be with advantage omitted from the address, which would therefore run - The Cottage, Castleton of Braemar.</p>
