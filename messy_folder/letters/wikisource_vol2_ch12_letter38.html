<p><b>Letter: TO MRS. BAKER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, JULY 16, 1894.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. BAKER, - I am very much obliged to you for your letter and the enclosure from Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner says he 'thinks Mr. Stevenson must be a very kind man'; he little knows me. But I am very sure of one thing, that you are a very kind woman. I envy you - my amanuensis being called away, I continue in my own hand, or what is left of it - unusually legible, I am thankful to see - I envy you your beautiful choice of an employment. There must be no regrets at least for a day so spent; and when the night falls you need ask no blessing on your work.</p>
<p>'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these.' - Yours truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
