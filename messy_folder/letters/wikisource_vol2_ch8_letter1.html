<p><b>Letter: TO MRS. DE MATTOS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], JANUARY 1ST, 1886.</p>
<p>DEAREST KATHARINE, - Here, on a very little book and accompanied with lame verses, I have put your name. Our kindness is now getting well on in years; it must be nearly of age; and it gets more valuable to me with every time I see you. It is not possible to express any sentiment, and it is not necessary to try, at least between us. You know very well that I love you dearly, and that I always will. I only wish the verses were better, but at least you like the story; and it is sent to you by the one that loves you - Jekyll, and not Hyde.</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
<p>AVE!</p>
<p>Bells upon the city are ringing in the night; High above the gardens are the houses full of light; On the heathy Pentlands is the curlew flying free; And the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie.</p>
<p>We cannae break the bonds that God decreed to bind, Still we'll be the children of the heather and the wind; Far away from home, O, it's still for you and me That the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie!</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
