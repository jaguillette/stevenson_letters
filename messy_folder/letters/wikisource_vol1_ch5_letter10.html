<p>Letter: TO HORATIO F. BROWN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DAVOS, 1881.</p>
<p>MY DEAR BROWN. - Here it is, with the mark of a San Francisco BOUQUINISTE. And if ever in all my 'human conduct' I have done a better thing to any fellow-creature than handing on to you this sweet, dignified, and wholesome book, I know I shall hear of it on the last day. To write a book like this were impossible; at least one can hand it on - with a wrench - one to another. My wife cries out and my own heart misgives me, but still here it is. I could scarcely better prove myself - Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>R. L. STEVENSON.</p>
