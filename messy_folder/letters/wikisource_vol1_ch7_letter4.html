<p>Letter: TO ANDREW CHATTO</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>WENSLEYDALE, BOURNEMOUTH, OCTOBER 3, 1884.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. CHATTO, - I have an offer of 25 pounds for OTTO from America. I do not know if you mean to have the American rights; from the nature of the contract, I think not; but if you understood that you were to sell the sheets, I will either hand over the bargain to you, or finish it myself and hand you over the money if you are pleased with the amount. You see, I leave this quite in your hands. To parody an old Scotch story of servant and master: if you don't know that you have a good author, I know that I have a good publisher. Your fair, open, and handsome dealings are a good point in my life, and do more for my crazy health than has yet been done by any doctor. - Very truly yours,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
