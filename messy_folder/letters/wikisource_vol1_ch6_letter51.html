<p>Letter: TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>HOTEL CHABASSIERE, ROYAT, [JULY 1884].</p>
<p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - The weather has been demoniac; I have had a skiff of cold, and was finally obliged to take to bed entirely; to-day, however, it has cleared, the sun shines, and I begin to</p>
<p>(SEVERAL DAYS AFTER.)</p>
<p>I have been out once, but now am back in bed. I am better, and keep better, but the weather is a mere injustice. The imitation of Edinburgh is, at times, deceptive; there is a note among the chimney pots that suggests Howe Street; though I think the shrillest spot in Christendom was not upon the Howe Street side, but in front, just under the Miss Graemes' big chimney stack. It had a fine alto character - a sort of bleat that used to divide the marrow in my joints - say in the wee, slack hours. That music is now lost to us by rebuilding; another air that I remember, not regret, was the solo of the gas-burner in the little front room; a knickering, flighty, fleering, and yet spectral cackle. I mind it above all on winter afternoons, late, when the window was blue and spotted with rare rain-drops, and, looking out, the cold evening was seen blue all over, with the lamps of Queen's and Frederick's Street dotting it with yellow, and flaring east-ward in the squalls. Heavens, how unhappy I have been in such circumstances - I, who have now positively forgotten the colour of unhappiness; who am full like a fed ox, and dull like a fresh turf, and have no more spiritual life, for good or evil, than a French bagman.</p>
<p>We are at Chabassiere's, for of course it was nonsense to go up the hill when we could not walk.</p>
<p>The child's poems in a far extended form are likely soon to be heard of - which Cummy I dare say will be glad to know. They will make a book of about one hundred pages. - Ever your affectionate,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
