<p><b>Letter: TO MARCEL SCHWOB</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS, FEBRUARY 8TH, 1889.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, - I thank you - from the midst of such a flurry as you can imagine, with seven months' accumulated correspondence on my table - for your two friendly and clever letters. Pray write me again. I shall be home in May or June, and not improbably shall come to Paris in the summer. Then we can talk; or in the interval I may be able to write, which is to-day out of the question. Pray take a word from a man of crushing occupations, and count it as a volume. Your little CONTE is delightful. Ah yes, you are right, I love the eighteenth century; and so do you, and have not listened to its voice in vain. - The Hunted One,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
