<p>Letter: TO DR. ALEXANDER JAPP</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, MARCH 1882.]</p>
<p>MY DEAR DR. JAPP, - You must think me a forgetful rogue, as indeed I am; for I have but now told my publisher to send you a copy of the FAMILIAR STUDIES. However, I own I have delayed this letter till I could send you the enclosed. Remembering the nights at Braemar when we visited the Picture Gallery, I hoped they might amuse you. You see, we do some publishing hereaway. I shall hope to see you in town in May. - Always yours faithfully,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
