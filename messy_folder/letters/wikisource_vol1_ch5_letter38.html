<p>Letter: TO CHARLES BAXTER</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS], 22ND FEBRUARY '82.</p>
<p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Your most welcome letter has raised clouds of sulphur from my horizon. . . .</p>
<p>I am glad you have gone back to your music. Life is a poor thing, I am more and more convinced, without an art, that always waits for us and is always new. Art and marriage are two very good stand- by's.</p>
<p>In an article which will appear sometime in the CORNHILL, 'Talk and Talkers,' and where I have full-lengthened the conversation of Bob, Henley, Jenkin, Simpson, Symonds, and Gosse, I have at the end one single word about yourself. It may amuse you to see it.</p>
<p>We are coming to Scotland after all, so we shall meet, which pleases me, and I do believe I am strong enough to stand it this time. My knee is still quite lame.</p>
<p>My wife is better again. . . . But we take it by turns; it is the dog that is ill now. - Ever yours,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
