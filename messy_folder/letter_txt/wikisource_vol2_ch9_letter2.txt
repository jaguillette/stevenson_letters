Letter: TO W. H. LOW

[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], August 6TH, 1887.
MY DEAR LOW, - We - my mother, my wife, my stepson, my maidservant, and myself, five souls - leave, if all is well, Aug. 20th, per Wilson line SS. LUDGATE HILL. Shall probably evade N. Y. at first, cutting straight to a watering-place: Newport, I believe, its name. Afterwards we shall steal incognito into LA BONNE VILLA, and see no one but you and the Scribners, if it may be so managed. You must understand I have been very seedy indeed, quite a dead body; and unless the voyage does miracles, I shall have to draw it dam fine. Alas, 'The Canoe Speaks' is now out of date; it will figure in my volume of verses now imminent. However, I may find some inspiration some day. - Till very soon, yours ever,
R. L. S.
