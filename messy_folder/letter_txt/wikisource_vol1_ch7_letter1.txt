Letter: TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON

WENSLEYDALE, BOURNEMOUTH, SUNDAY, 28TH SEPTEMBER 1884.
MY DEAR PEOPLE, - I keep better, and am to-day downstairs for the first time. I find the lockers entirely empty; not a cent to the front. Will you pray send us some? It blows an equinoctial gale, and has blown for nearly a week. Nimbus Britannicus; piping wind, lashing rain; the sea is a fine colour, and wind-bound ships lie at anchor under the Old Harry rocks, to make one glad to be ashore.
The Henleys are gone, and two plays practically done. I hope they may produce some of the ready. - I am, ever affectionate son,
R. L. S.
