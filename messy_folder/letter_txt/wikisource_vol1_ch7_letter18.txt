Letter: TO H. A. JONES

BONALLIE TOWERS, BRANKSOME PARK, BOURNEMOUTH, DEC. 30, 1884.
DEAR SIR, - I am so accustomed to hear nonsense spoken about all the arts, and the drama in particular, that I cannot refrain from saying 'Thank you,' for your paper. In my answer to Mr. James, in the December LONGMAN, you may see that I have merely touched, I think in a parenthesis, on the drama; but I believe enough was said to indicate our agreement in essentials.
Wishing you power and health to further enunciate and to act upon these principles, believe me, dear sir, yours truly,
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
