Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>COCKFIELD RECTORY, SUDBURY, SUFFOLK, TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1873.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I am too happy to be much of a correspondent.  
Yesterday we were away to Melford and Lavenham, both exceptionally 
placid, beautiful old English towns.  Melford scattered all round a 
big green, with an Elizabethan Hall and Park, great screens of 
trees that seem twice as high as trees should seem, and everything 
else like what ought to be in a novel, and what one never expects 
to see in reality, made me cry out how good we were to live in 
Scotland, for the many hundredth time.  I cannot get over my 
astonishment - indeed, it increases every day - at the hopeless 
gulf that there is between England and Scotland, and English and 
Scotch.  Nothing is the same; and I feel as strange and outlandish 
here as I do in France or Germany.  Everything by the wayside, in 
the houses, or about the people, strikes me with an unexpected 
unfamiliarity:  I walk among surprises, for just where you think 
you have them, something wrong turns up.
</p><p>I got a little Law read yesterday, and some German this morning, 
but on the whole there are too many amusements going for much work; 
as for correspondence, I have neither heart nor time for it to-day.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 1873.
</p><p>I HAVE been to-day a very long walk with my father through some of 
the most beautiful ways hereabouts; the day was cold with an iron, 
windy sky, and only glorified now and then with autumn sunlight.  
For it is fully autumn with us, with a blight already over the 
greens, and a keen wind in the morning that makes one rather timid 
of one's tub when it finds its way indoors.
</p><p>I was out this evening to call on a friend, and, coming back 
through the wet, crowded, lamp-lit streets, was singing after my 
own fashion, DU HAST DIAMANTEN UND PERLEN, when I heard a poor 
cripple man in the gutter wailing over a pitiful Scotch air, his 
club-foot supported on the other knee, and his whole woebegone body 
propped sideways against a crutch.  The nearest lamp threw a strong 
light on his worn, sordid face and the three boxes of lucifer 
matches that he held for sale.  My own false notes stuck in my 
chest.  How well off I am! is the burthen of my songs all day long 
- DRUM IST SO WOHL MIR IN DER WELT! and the ugly reality of the 
cripple man was an intrusion on the beautiful world in which I was 
walking.  He could no more sing than I could; and his voice was 
cracked and rusty, and altogether perished.  To think that that 
wreck may have walked the streets some night years ago, as glad at 
heart as I was, and promising himself a future as golden and 
honourable!
</p><p>SUNDAY, 11.20 A.M. - I wonder what you are doing now? - in church 
likely, at the TE DEUM.  Everything here is utterly silent.  I can 
hear men's footfalls streets away; the whole life of Edinburgh has 
been sucked into sundry pious edifices; the gardens below my 
windows are steeped in a diffused sunlight, and every tree seems 
standing on tiptoes, strained and silent, as though to get its head 
above its neighbour's and LISTEN.  You know what I mean, don't you?  
How trees do seem silently to assert themselves on an occasion!  I 
have been trying to write ROADS until I feel as if I were standing 
on my head; but I mean ROADS, and shall do something to them.
</p><p>I wish I could make you feel the hush that is over everything, only 
made the more perfect by rare interruptions; and the rich, placid 
light, and the still, autumnal foliage.  Houses, you know, stand 
all about our gardens:  solid, steady blocks of houses; all look 
empty and asleep.
</p><p>MONDAY NIGHT. - The drums and fifes up in the Castle are sounding 
the guard-call through the dark, and there is a great rattle of 
carriages without.  I have had (I must tell you) my bed taken out 
of this room, so that I am alone in it with my books and two 
tables, and two chairs, and a coal-skuttle (or SCUTTLE) (?) and a 
DEBRIS of broken pipes in a corner, and my old school play-box, so 
full of papers and books that the lid will not shut down, standing 
reproachfully in the midst.  There is something in it that is still 
a little gaunt and vacant; it needs a little populous disorder over 
it to give it the feel of homeliness, and perhaps a bit more 
furniture, just to take the edge off the sense of illimitable 
space, eternity, and a future state, and the like, that is brought 
home to one, even in this small attic, by the wide, empty floor.
</p><p>You would require to know, what only I can ever know, many grim and 
many maudlin passages out of my past life to feel how great a 
change has been made for me by this past summer.  Let me be ever so 
poor and thread-paper a soul, I am going to try for the best.
</p><p>These good booksellers of mine have at last got a WERTHER without 
illustrations.  I want you to like Charlotte.  Werther himself has 
every feebleness and vice that could tend to make his suicide a 
most virtuous and commendable action; and yet I like Werther too - 
I don't know why, except that he has written the most delightful 
letters in the world.  Note, by the way, the passage under date 
June 21st not far from the beginning; it finds a voice for a great 
deal of dumb, uneasy, pleasurable longing that we have all had, 
times without number.  I looked that up the other day for ROADS, so 
I know the reference; but you will find it a garden of flowers from 
beginning to end.  All through the passion keeps steadily rising, 
from the thunderstorm at the country-house - there was thunder in 
that story too - up to the last wild delirious interview; either 
Lotte was no good at all, or else Werther should have remained 
alive after that; either he knew his woman too well, or else he was 
precipitate.  But an idiot like that is hopeless; and yet, he 
wasn't an idiot - I make reparation, and will offer eighteen pounds 
of best wax at his tomb.  Poor devil! he was only the weakest - or, 
at least, a very weak strong man.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1873.
</p><p>. . . I WAS over last night, contrary to my own wish, in Leven, 
Fife; and this morning I had a conversation of which, I think, some 
account might interest you.  I was up with a cousin who was fishing 
in a mill-lade, and a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a 
tumbledown steading attached to the mill.  There I found a labourer 
cleaning a byre, with whom I fell into talk.  The man was to all 
appearance as heavy, as HEBETE, as any English clodhopper; but I 
knew I was in Scotland, and launched out forthright into Education 
and Politics and the aims of one's life.  I told him how I had 
found the peasantry in Suffolk, and added that their state had made 
me feel quite pained and down-hearted.  'It but to do that,' he 
said, 'to onybody that thinks at a'!'  Then, again, he said that he 
could not conceive how anything could daunt or cast down a man who 
had an aim in life.  'They that have had a guid schoolin' and do 
nae mair, whatever they do, they have done; but him that has aye 
something ayont need never be weary.'  I have had to mutilate the 
dialect much, so that it might be comprehensible to you; but I 
think the sentiment will keep, even through a change of words, 
something of the heartsome ring of encouragement that it had for 
me:  and that from a man cleaning a byre!  You see what John Knox 
and his schools have done.
</p><p>SATURDAY. - This has been a charming day for me from morning to now 
(5 P.M.).  First, I found your letter, and went down and read it on 
a seat in those Public Gardens of which you have heard already.  
After lunch, my father and I went down to the coast and walked a 
little way along the shore between Granton and Cramond.  This has 
always been with me a very favourite walk.  The Firth closes 
gradually together before you, the coast runs in a series of the 
most beautifully moulded bays, hill after hill, wooded and softly 
outlined, trends away in front till the two shores join together.  
When the tide is out there are great, gleaming flats of wet sand, 
over which the gulls go flying and crying; and every cape runs down 
into them with its little spit of wall and trees.  We lay together 
a long time on the beach; the sea just babbled among the stones; 
and at one time we heard the hollow, sturdy beat of the paddles of 
an unseen steamer somewhere round the cape.  I am glad to say that 
the peace of the day and scenery was not marred by any 
unpleasantness between us two.
</p><p>I am, unhappily, off my style, and can do nothing well; indeed, I 
fear I have marred ROADS finally by patching at it when I was out 
of the humour.  Only, I am beginning to see something great about 
John Knox and Queen Mary:  I like them both so much, that I feel as 
if I could write the history fairly.
</p><p>I have finished ROADS to-day, and send it off to you to see.  The 
Lord knows whether it is worth anything! - some of it pleases me a 
good deal, but I fear it is quite unfit for any possible magazine.  
However, I wish you to see it, as you know the humour in which it 
was conceived, walking alone and very happily about the Suffolk 
highways and byeways on several splendid sunny afternoons. - 
Believe me, ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>MONDAY. - I have looked over ROADS again, and I am aghast at its 
feebleness.  It is the trial of a very <i>prentice hand' indeed.  </i>
Shall I ever learn to do anything well?  However, it shall go to 
you, for the reasons given above.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>EDINBURGH, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1873.
</p><p>. . . I MUST be very strong to have all this vexation and still to 
be well.  I was weighed the other day, and the gross weight of my 
large person was eight stone six!  Does it not seem surprising that 
I can keep the lamp alight, through all this gusty weather, in so 
frail a lantern?  And yet it burns cheerily.
</p><p>My mother is leaving for the country this morning, and my father 
and I will be alone for the best part of the week in this house.  
Then on Friday I go south to Dumfries till Monday.  I must write 
small, or I shall have a tremendous budget by then.
</p><p>7.20 P.M. - I must tell you a thing I saw to-day.  I was going down 
to Portobello in the train, when there came into the next 
compartment (third class) an artisan, strongly marked with 
smallpox, and with sunken, heavy eyes - a face hard and unkind, and 
without anything lovely.  There was a woman on the platform seeing 
him off.  At first sight, with her one eye blind and the whole cast 
of her features strongly plebeian, and even vicious, she seemed as 
unpleasant as the man; but there was something beautifully soft, a 
sort of light of tenderness, as on some Dutch Madonna, that came 
over her face when she looked at the man.  They talked for a while 
together through the window; the man seemed to have been asking 
money.  'Ye ken the last time,' she said, 'I gave ye two shillin's 
for your ludgin', and ye said - ' it died off into whisper.  
Plainly Falstaff and Dame Quickly over again.  The man laughed 
unpleasantly, even cruelly, and said something; and the woman 
turned her back on the carriage and stood a long while so, and, do 
what I might, I could catch no glimpse of her expression, although 
I thought I saw the heave of a sob in her shoulders.  At last, 
after the train was already in motion, she turned round and put two 
shillings into his hand.  I saw her stand and look after us with a 
perfect heaven of love on her face - this poor one-eyed Madonna - 
until the train was out of sight; but the man, sordidly happy with 
his gains, did not put himself to the inconvenience of one glance 
to thank her for her ill-deserved kindness.
</p><p>I have been up at the Spec. and looked out a reference I wanted.  
The whole town is drowned in white, wet vapour off the sea.  
Everything drips and soaks.  The very statues seem wet to the skin.  
I cannot pretend to be very cheerful; I did not see one contented 
face in the streets; and the poor did look so helplessly chill and 
dripping, without a stitch to change, or so much as a fire to dry 
themselves at, or perhaps money to buy a meal, or perhaps even a 
bed.  My heart shivers for them.
</p><p>DUMFRIES, FRIDAY. - All my thirst for a little warmth, a little 
sun, a little corner of blue sky avails nothing.  Without, the rain 
falls with a long drawn SWISH, and the night is as dark as a vault.  
There is no wind indeed, and that is a blessed change after the 
unruly, bedlamite gusts that have been charging against one round 
street corners and utterly abolishing and destroying all that is 
peaceful in life.  Nothing sours my temper like these coarse 
termagant winds.  I hate practical joking; and your vulgarest 
practical joker is your flaw of wind.
</p><p>I have tried to write some verses; but I find I have nothing to say 
that has not been already perfectly said and perfectly sung in 
ADELAIDE.  I have so perfect an idea out of that song!  The great 
Alps, a wonder in the starlight - the river, strong from the hills, 
and turbulent, and loudly audible at night - the country, a scented 
FRUHLINGSGARTEN of orchards and deep wood where the nightingales 
harbour - a sort of German flavour over all - and this love-drunken 
man, wandering on by sleeping village and silent town, pours out of 
his full heart, EINST, O WUNDER, EINST, etc.  I wonder if I am 
wrong about this being the most beautiful and perfect thing in the 
world - the only marriage of really accordant words and music - 
both drunk with the same poignant, unutterable sentiment.
</p><p>To-day in Glasgow my father went off on some business, and my 
mother and I wandered about for two hours.  We had lunch together, 
and were very merry over what the people at the restaurant would 
think of us - mother and son they could not suppose us to be.
</p><p>SATURDAY. - And to-day it came - warmth, sunlight, and a strong, 
hearty living wind among the trees.  I found myself a new being.  
My father and I went off a long walk, through a country most 
beautifully wooded and various, under a range of hills.  You should 
have seen one place where the wood suddenly fell away in front of 
us down a long, steep hill between a double row of trees, with one 
small fair-haired child framed in shadow in the foreground; and 
when we got to the foot there was the little kirk and kirkyard of 
Irongray, among broken fields and woods by the side of the bright, 
rapid river.  In the kirkyard there was a wonderful congregation of 
tombstones, upright and recumbent on four legs (after our Scotch 
fashion), and of flat-armed fir-trees.  One gravestone was erected 
by Scott (at a cost, I learn, of 70 pounds) to the poor woman who 
served him as heroine in the HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN, and the 
inscription in its stiff, Jedediah Cleishbotham fashion is not 
without something touching.  We went up the stream a little further 
to where two Covenanters lie buried in an oakwood; the tombstone 
(as the custom is) containing the details of their grim little 
tragedy in funnily bad rhyme, one verse of which sticks in my 
memory:-
</p><p><br />
'We died, their furious rage to stay,
Near to the kirk of Iron-gray.'
</p><p><br />
We then fetched a long compass round about through Holywood Kirk 
and Lincluden ruins to Dumfries.  But the walk came sadly to grief 
as a pleasure excursion before our return . . .
</p><p>SUNDAY. - Another beautiful day.  My father and I walked into 
Dumfries to church.  When the service was done I noted the two 
halberts laid against the pillar of the churchyard gate; and as I 
had not seen the little weekly pomp of civic dignitaries in our 
Scotch country towns for some years, I made my father wait.  You 
should have seen the provost and three bailies going stately away 
down the sunlit street, and the two town servants strutting in 
front of them, in red coats and cocked hats, and with the halberts 
most conspicuously shouldered.  We saw Burns's house - a place that 
made me deeply sad - and spent the afternoon down the banks of the 
Nith.  I had not spent a day by a river since we lunched in the 
meadows near Sudbury.  The air was as pure and clear and sparkling 
as spring water; beautiful, graceful outlines of hill and wood shut 
us in on every side; and the swift, brown river fled smoothly away 
from before our eyes, rippled over with oily eddies and dimples.  
White gulls had come up from the sea to fish, and hovered and flew 
hither and thither among the loops of the stream.  By good fortune, 
too, it was a dead calm between my father and me.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH], SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1873.
</p><p>IT is a little sharp to-day; but bright and sunny with a sparkle in 
the air, which is delightful after four days of unintermitting 
rain.  In the streets I saw two men meet after a long separation, 
it was plain.  They came forward with a little run and LEAPED at 
each other's hands.  You never saw such bright eyes as they both 
had.  It put one in a good humour to see it.
</p><p><br />
8 P.M. - I made a little more out of my work than I have made for a 
long while back; though even now I cannot make things fall into 
sentences - they only sprawl over the paper in bald orphan clauses.  
Then I was about in the afternoon with Baxter; and we had a good 
deal of fun, first rhyming on the names of all the shops we passed, 
and afterwards buying needles and quack drugs from open-air 
vendors, and taking much pleasure in their inexhaustible eloquence.  
Every now and then as we went, Arthur's Seat showed its head at the 
end of a street.  Now, to-day the blue sky and the sunshine were 
both entirely wintry; and there was about the hill, in these 
glimpses, a sort of thin, unreal, crystalline distinctness that I 
have not often seen excelled.  As the sun began to go down over the 
valley between the new town and the old, the evening grew 
resplendent; all the gardens and low-lying buildings sank back and 
became almost invisible in a mist of wonderful sun, and the Castle 
stood up against the sky, as thin and sharp in outline as a castle 
cut out of paper.  Baxter made a good remark about Princes Street, 
that it was the most elastic street for length that he knew; 
sometimes it looks, as it looked to-night, interminable, a way 
leading right into the heart of the red sundown; sometimes, again, 
it shrinks together, as if for warmth, on one of the withering, 
clear east-windy days, until it seems to lie underneath your feet.
</p><p>I want to let you see these verses from an ODE TO THE CUCKOO, 
written by one of the ministers of Leith in the middle of last 
century - the palmy days of Edinburgh - who was a friend of Hume 
and Adam Smith and the whole constellation.  The authorship of 
these beautiful verses has been most truculently fought about; but 
whoever wrote them (and it seems as if this Logan had) they are 
lovely -
</p><p><br />
'What time the pea puts on the bloom,
Thou fliest the vocal vale,
An annual guest, in other lands
Another spring to hail.
</p><p>Sweet bird! thy bower is ever green,
Thy sky is ever clear;
Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,
No winter in thy year.
</p><p>O could I fly, I'd fly with thee!
We'd make on joyful wing
Our annual visit o'er the globe,
Companions of the spring.'
</p><p><br />
SUNDAY. - I have been at church with my mother, where we heard 
'Arise, shine,' sung excellently well, and my mother was so much 
upset with it that she nearly had to leave church.  This was the 
antidote, however, to fifty minutes of solid sermon, varra heavy.  
I have been sticking in to Walt Whitman; nor do I think I have ever 
laboured so hard to attain so small a success.  Still, the thing is 
taking shape, I think; I know a little better what I want to say 
all through; and in process of time, possibly I shall manage to say 
it.  I must say I am a very bad workman, MAIS J'AI DU COURAGE; I am 
indefatigable at rewriting and bettering, and surely that humble 
quality should get me on a little.
</p><p>MONDAY, OCTOBER 6. - It is a magnificent glimmering moonlight 
night, with a wild, great west wind abroad, flapping above one like 
an immense banner, and every now and again swooping furiously 
against my windows.  The wind is too strong perhaps, and the trees 
are certainly too leafless for much of that wide rustle that we 
both remember; there is only a sharp, angry, sibilant hiss, like 
breath drawn with the strength of the elements through shut teeth, 
that one hears between the gusts only.  I am in excellent humour 
with myself, for I have worked hard and not altogether fruitlessly; 
and I wished before I turned in just to tell you that things were 
so.  My dear friend, I feel so happy when I think that you remember 
me kindly.  I have been up to-night lecturing to a friend on life 
and duties and what a man could do; a coal off the altar had been 
laid on my lips, and I talked quite above my average, and hope I 
spread, what you would wish to see spread, into one person's heart; 
and with a new light upon it.
</p><p>I shall tell you a story.  Last Friday I went down to Portobello, 
in the heavy rain, with an uneasy wind blowing PAR RAFALES off the 
sea (or 'EN RAFALES' should it be? or what?).  As I got down near 
the beach a poor woman, oldish, and seemingly, lately at least, 
respectable, followed me and made signs.  She was drenched to the 
skin, and looked wretched below wretchedness.  You know, I did not 
like to look back at her; it seemed as if she might misunderstand 
and be terribly hurt and slighted; so I stood at the end of the 
street - there was no one else within sight in the wet - and lifted 
up my hand very high with some money in it.  I heard her steps draw 
heavily near behind me, and, when she was near enough to see, I let 
the money fall in the mud and went off at my best walk without ever 
turning round.  There is nothing in the story; and yet you will 
understand how much there is, if one chose to set it forth.  You 
see, she was so ugly; and you know there is something terribly, 
miserably pathetic in a certain smile, a certain sodden aspect of 
invitation on such faces.  It is so terrible, that it is in a way 
sacred; it means the outside of degradation and (what is worst of 
all in life) false position.  I hope you understand me rightly. - 
Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH], TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1873.
</p><p>MY father has returned in better health, and I am more delighted 
than I can well tell you.  The one trouble that I can see no way 
through is that his health, or my mother's, should give way.  To-
night, as I was walking along Princes Street, I heard the bugles 
sound the recall.  I do not think I had ever remarked it before; 
there is something of unspeakable appeal in the cadence.  I felt as 
if something yearningly cried to me out of the darkness overhead to 
come thither and find rest; one felt as if there must be warm 
hearts and bright fires waiting for one up there, where the buglers 
stood on the damp pavement and sounded their friendly invitation 
forth into the night.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY. - I may as well tell you exactly about my health.  I am 
not at all ill; have quite recovered; only I am what MM. LES 
MEDECINS call below par; which, in plain English, is that I am 
weak.  With tonics, decent weather, and a little cheerfulness, that 
will go away in its turn, and I shall be all right again.
</p><p>I am glad to hear what you say about the Exam.; until quite lately 
I have treated that pretty cavalierly, for I say honestly that I do 
not mind being plucked; I shall just have to go up again.  We 
travelled with the Lord Advocate the other day, and he strongly 
advised me in my father's hearing to go to the English Bar; and the 
Lord Advocate's advice goes a long way in Scotland.  It is a sort 
of special legal revelation.  Don't misunderstand me.  I don't, of 
course, want to be plucked; but so far as my style of knowledge 
suits them, I cannot make much betterment on it in a month.  If 
they wish scholarship more exact, I must take a new lease 
altogether.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - My head and eyes both gave in this morning, and I had 
to take a day of complete idleness.  I was in the open air all day, 
and did no thought that I could avoid, and I think I have got my 
head between my shoulders again; however, I am not going to do 
much.  I don't want you to run away with any fancy about my being 
ill.  Given a person weak and in some trouble, and working longer 
hours than he is used to, and you have the matter in a nutshell.  
You should have seen the sunshine on the hill to-day; it has lost 
now that crystalline clearness, as if the medium were spring-water 
(you see, I am stupid!); but it retains that wonderful thinness of 
outline that makes the delicate shape and hue savour better in 
one's mouth, like fine wine out of a finely-blown glass.  The birds 
are all silent now but the crows.  I sat a long time on the stairs 
that lead down to Duddingston Loch - a place as busy as a great 
town during frost, but now solitary and silent; and when I shut my 
eyes I heard nothing but the wind in the trees; and you know all 
that went through me, I dare say, without my saying it.
</p><p>II. - I am now all right.  I do not expect any tic to-night, and 
shall be at work again to-morrow.  I have had a day of open air, 
only a little modified by LE CAPITAINE FRACASSE before the dining-
room fire.  I must write no more, for I am sleepy after two nights, 
and to quote my book, 'SINON BLANCHES, DU MOINS GRISES'; and so I 
must go to bed and faithfully, hoggishly slumber. - Your faithful
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MENTONE, NOVEMBER 13, 1873.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - The PLACE is not where I thought; it is about 
where the old Post Office was.  The Hotel de Londres is no more an 
hotel.  I have found a charming room in the Hotel du Pavillon, just 
across the road from the Prince's Villa; it has one window to the 
south and one to the east, with a superb view of Mentone and the 
hills, to which I move this afternoon.  In the old great PLACE 
there is a kiosque for the sale of newspapers; a string of 
omnibuses (perhaps thirty) go up and down under the plane-trees of 
the Turin Road on the occasion of each train; the Promenade has 
crossed both streams, and bids fair to reach the Cap St. Martin.  
The old chapel near Freeman's house at the entrance to the Gorbio 
valley is now entirely submerged under a shining new villa, with 
Pavilion annexed; over which, in all the pride of oak and chestnut 
and divers coloured marbles, I was shown this morning by the 
obliging proprietor.  The Prince's Palace itself is rehabilitated, 
and shines afar with white window-curtains from the midst of a 
garden, all trim borders and greenhouses and carefully kept walks.  
On the other side, the villas are more thronged together, and they 
have arranged themselves, shelf after shelf, behind each other.  I 
see the glimmer of new buildings, too, as far eastward as Grimaldi; 
and a viaduct carries (I suppose) the railway past the mouth of the 
bone caves.  F. Bacon (Lord Chancellor) made the remark that 'Time 
was the greatest innovator'; it is perhaps as meaningless a remark 
as was ever made; but as Bacon made it, I suppose it is better than 
any that I could make.  Does it not seem as if things were fluid?  
They are displaced and altered in ten years so that one has 
difficulty, even with a memory so very vivid and retentive for that 
sort of thing as mine, in identifying places where one lived a long 
while in the past, and which one has kept piously in mind during 
all the interval.  Nevertheless, the hills, I am glad to say, are 
unaltered; though I dare say the torrents have given them many a 
shrewd scar, and the rains and thaws dislodged many a boulder from 
their heights, if one were only keen enough to perceive it.  The 
sea makes the same noise in the shingle; and the lemon and orange 
gardens still discharge in the still air their fresh perfume; and 
the people have still brown comely faces; and the Pharmacie Gros 
still dispenses English medicines; and the invalids (eheu!) still 
sit on the promenade and trifle with their fingers in the fringes 
of shawls and wrappers; and the shop of Pascal Amarante still, in 
its present bright consummate flower of aggrandisement and new 
paint, offers everything that it has entered into people's hearts 
to wish for in the idleness of a sanatorium; and the 'Chateau des 
Morts' is still at the top of the town; and the fort and the jetty 
are still at the foot, only there are now two jetties; and - I am 
out of breath.  (To be continued in our next.)
</p><p>For myself, I have come famously through the journey; and as I have 
written this letter (for the first time for ever so long) with ease 
and even pleasure, I think my head must be better.  I am still no 
good at coming down hills or stairs; and my feet are more 
consistently cold than is quite comfortable.  But, these apart, I 
feel well; and in good spirits all round.
</p><p>I have written to Nice for letters, and hope to get them to-night.  
Continue to address Poste Restante.  Take care of yourselves.
</p><p>This is my birthday, by the way - O, I said that before.  Adieu. - 
Ever your affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MENTONE, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1873.
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - I sat a long while up among the olive yards to-
day at a favourite corner, where one has a fair view down the 
valley and on to the blue floor of the sea.  I had a Horace with 
me, and read a little; but Horace, when you try to read him fairly 
under the open heaven, sounds urban, and you find something of the 
escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country, just as 
somebody said that Morris's sea-pieces were all taken from the 
coast.  I tried for long to hit upon some language that might catch 
ever so faintly the indefinable shifting colour of olive leaves; 
and, above all, the changes and little silverings that pass over 
them, like blushes over a face, when the wind tosses great branches 
to and fro; but the Muse was not favourable.  A few birds scattered 
here and there at wide intervals on either side of the valley sang 
the little broken songs of late autumn and there was a great stir 
of insect life in the grass at my feet.  The path up to this coign 
of vantage, where I think I shall make it a habit to ensconce 
myself a while of a morning, is for a little while common to the 
peasant and a little clear brooklet.  It is pleasant, in the 
tempered grey daylight of the olive shadows, to see the people 
picking their way among the stones and the water and the brambles; 
the women especially, with the weights poised on their heads and 
walking all from the hips with a certain graceful deliberation.
</p><p>TUESDAY. - I have been to Nice to-day to see Dr. Bennet; he agrees 
with Clark that there is no disease; but I finished up my day with 
a lamentable exhibition of weakness.  I could not remember French, 
or at least I was afraid to go into any place lest I should not be 
able to remember it, and so could not tell when the train went.  At 
last I crawled up to the station and sat down on the steps, and 
just steeped myself there in the sunshine until the evening began 
to fall and the air to grow chilly.  This long rest put me all 
right; and I came home here triumphantly and ate dinner well.  
There is the full, true, and particular account of the worst day I 
have had since I left London.  I shall not go to Nice again for 
some time to come.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - I am to-day quite recovered, and got into Mentone to-
day for a book, which is quite a creditable walk.  As an 
intellectual being I have not yet begun to re-exist; my immortal 
soul is still very nearly extinct; but we must hope the best.  Now, 
do take warning by me.  I am set up by a beneficent providence at 
the corner of the road, to warn you to flee from the hebetude that 
is to follow.  Being sent to the South is not much good unless you 
take your soul with you, you see; and my soul is rarely with me 
here.  I don't see much beauty.  I have lost the key; I can only be 
placid and inert, and see the bright days go past uselessly one 
after another; therefore don't talk foolishly with your mouth any 
more about getting liberty by being ill and going south VIA the 
sickbed.  It is not the old free-born bird that gets thus to 
freedom; but I know not what manacled and hide-bound spirit, 
incapable of pleasure, the clay of a man.  Go south!  Why, I saw 
more beauty with my eyes healthfully alert to see in two wet windy 
February afternoons in Scotland than I can see in my beautiful 
olive gardens and grey hills in a whole week in my low and lost 
estate, as the Shorter Catechism puts it somewhere.  It is a 
pitiable blindness, this blindness of the soul; I hope it may not 
be long with me.  So remember to keep well; and remember rather 
anything than not to keep well; and again I say, ANYTHING rather 
than not to keep well.
</p><p>Not that I am unhappy, mind you.  I have found the words already - 
placid and inert, that is what I am.  I sit in the sun and enjoy 
the tingle all over me, and I am cheerfully ready to concur with 
any one who says that this is a beautiful place, and I have a 
sneaking partiality for the newspapers, which would be all very 
well, if one had not fallen from heaven and were not troubled with 
some reminiscence of the INEFFABLE AURORE.
</p><p>To sit by the sea and to be conscious of nothing but the sound of 
the waves, and the sunshine over all your body, is not unpleasant; 
but I was an Archangel once.
</p><p>FRIDAY. - If you knew how old I felt!  I am sure this is what age 
brings with it - this carelessness, this disenchantment, this 
continual bodily weariness.  I am a man of seventy:  O Medea, kill 
me, or make me young again!
</p><p>To-day has been cloudy and mild; and I have lain a great while on a 
bench outside the garden wall (my usual place now) and looked at 
the dove-coloured sea and the broken roof of cloud, but there was 
no seeing in my eye.  Let us hope to-morrow will be more 
profitable.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL MIRABEAU, MENTONE, SUNDAY, JANUARY 4, 1874.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - We have here fallen on the very pink of hotels.  
I do not say that it is more pleasantly conducted than the 
Pavillon, for that were impossible; but the rooms are so cheery and 
bright and new, and then the food!  I never, I think, so fully 
appreciated the phrase 'the fat of the land' as I have done since I 
have been here installed.  There was a dish of eggs at DEJEUNER the 
other day, over the memory of which I lick my lips in the silent 
watches.
</p><p>Now that the cold has gone again, I continue to keep well in body, 
and already I begin to walk a little more.  My head is still a very 
feeble implement, and easily set a-spinning; and I can do nothing 
in the way of work beyond reading books that may, I hope, be of 
some use to me afterwards.
</p><p>I was very glad to see that M'Laren was sat upon, and principally 
for the reason why.  Deploring as I do much of the action of the 
Trades Unions, these conspiracy clauses and the whole partiality of 
the Master and Servant Act are a disgrace to our equal laws.  Equal 
laws become a byeword when what is legal for one class becomes a 
criminal offence for another.  It did my heart good to hear that 
man tell M'Laren how, as he had talked much of getting the 
franchise for working men, he must now be content to see them use 
it now they had got it.  This is a smooth stone well planted in the 
foreheads of certain dilettanti radicals, after M'Laren's fashion, 
who are willing to give the working men words and wind, and votes 
and the like, and yet think to keep all the advantages, just or 
unjust, of the wealthier classes without abatement.  I do hope wise 
men will not attempt to fight the working men on the head of this 
notorious injustice.  Any such step will only precipitate the 
action of the newly enfranchised classes, and irritate them into 
acting hastily; when what we ought to desire should be that they 
should act warily and little for many years to come, until 
education and habit may make them the more fit.
</p><p>All this (intended for my father) is much after the fashion of his 
own correspondence.  I confess it has left my own head exhausted; I 
hope it may not produce the same effect on yours.  But I want him 
to look really into this question (both sides of it, and not the 
representations of rabid middle-class newspapers, sworn to support 
all the little tyrannies of wealth), and I know he will be 
convinced that this is a case of unjust law; and that, however 
desirable the end may seem to him, he will not be Jesuit enough to 
think that any end will justify an unjust law.
</p><p>Here ends the political sermon of your affectionate (and somewhat 
dogmatical) son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MENTONE, JANUARY 7, 1874.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I received yesterday two most charming letters - 
the nicest I have had since I left - December 26th and January 1st:  
this morning I got January 3rd.
</p><p>Into the bargain with Marie, the American girl, who is grace 
itself, and comes leaping and dancing simply like a wave - like 
nothing else, and who yesterday was Queen out of the Epiphany cake 
and chose Robinet (the French Painter) as her FAVORI with the most 
pretty confusion possible - into the bargain with Marie, we have 
two little Russian girls, with the youngest of whom, a little 
polyglot button of a three-year old, I had the most laughable 
little scene at lunch to-day.  I was watching her being fed with 
great amusement, her face being as broad as it is long, and her 
mouth capable of unlimited extension; when suddenly, her eye 
catching mine, the fashion of her countenance was changed, and 
regarding me with a really admirable appearance of offended 
dignity, she said something in Italian which made everybody laugh 
much.  It was explained to me that she had said I was very POLISSON 
to stare at her.  After this she was somewhat taken up with me, and 
after some examination she announced emphatically to the whole 
table, in German, that I was a MADCHEN; which word she repeated 
with shrill emphasis, as though fearing that her proposition would 
be called in question - MADCHEN, MADCHEN, MADCHEN, MADCHEN.  This 
hasty conclusion as to my sex she was led afterwards to revise, I 
am informed; but her new opinion (which seems to have been 
something nearer the truth) was announced in a third language quite 
unknown to me, and probably Russian.  To complete the scroll of her 
accomplishments, she was brought round the table after the meal was 
over, and said good-bye to me in very commendable English.
</p><p>The weather I shall say nothing about, as I am incapable of 
explaining my sentiments upon that subject before a lady.  But my 
health is really greatly improved:  I begin to recognise myself 
occasionally now and again, not without satisfaction.
</p><p>Please remember me very kindly to Professor Swan; I wish I had a 
story to send him; but story, Lord bless you, I have none to tell, 
sir, unless it is the foregoing adventure with the little polyglot.  
The best of that depends on the significance of POLISSON, which is 
beautifully out of place.
</p><p>SATURDAY, 10TH JANUARY. - The little Russian kid is only two and a 
half:  she speaks six languages.  She and her sister (aet. 8) and 
May Johnstone (aet. 8) are the delight of my life.  Last night I 
saw them all dancing - O it was jolly; kids are what is the matter 
with me.  After the dancing, we all - that is the two Russian 
ladies, Robinet the French painter, Mr. and Mrs. Johnstone, two 
governesses, and fitful kids joining us at intervals - played a 
game of the stool of repentance in the Gallic idiom.
</p><p>O - I have not told you that Colvin is gone; however, he is coming 
back again; he has left clothes in pawn to me. - Ever your 
affectionate son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MENTONE, TUESDAY, 13TH JANUARY 1874.
</p><p>. . . I LOST a Philipine to little Mary Johnstone last night; so 
to-day I sent her a rubbishing doll's toilet, and a little note 
with it, with some verses telling how happy children made every one 
near them happy also, and advising her to keep the lines, and some 
day, when she was 'grown a stately demoiselle,' it would make her 
'glad to know she gave pleasure long ago,' all in a very lame 
fashion, with just a note of prose at the end, telling her to mind 
her doll and the dog, and not trouble her little head just now to 
understand the bad verses; for some time when she was ill, as I am 
now, they would be plain to her and make her happy.  She has just 
been here to thank me, and has left me very happy.  Children are 
certainly too good to be true.
</p><p>Yesterday I walked too far, and spent all the afternoon on the 
outside of my bed; went finally to rest at nine, and slept nearly 
twelve hours on the stretch.  Bennet (the doctor), when told of it 
this morning, augured well for my recovery; he said youth must be 
putting in strong; of course I ought not to have slept at all.  As 
it was, I dreamed HORRIDLY; but not my usual dreams of social 
miseries and misunderstandings and all sorts of crucifixions of the 
spirit; but of good, cheery, physical things - of long successions 
of vaulted, dimly lit cellars full of black water, in which I went 
swimming among toads and unutterable, cold, blind fishes.  Now and 
then these cellars opened up into sort of domed music-hall places, 
where one could land for a little on the slope of the orchestra, 
but a sort of horror prevented one from staying long, and made one 
plunge back again into the dead waters.  Then my dream changed, and 
I was a sort of Siamese pirate, on a very high deck with several 
others.  The ship was almost captured, and we were fighting 
desperately.  The hideous engines we used and the perfectly 
incredible carnage that we effected by means of them kept me 
cheery, as you may imagine; especially as I felt all the time my 
sympathy with the boarders, and knew that I was only a prisoner 
with these horrid Malays.  Then I saw a signal being given, and 
knew they were going to blow up the ship.  I leaped right off, and 
heard my captors splash in the water after me as thick as pebbles 
when a bit of river bank has given way beneath the foot.  I never 
heard the ship blow up; but I spent the rest of the night swimming 
about some piles with the whole sea full of Malays, searching for 
me with knives in their mouths.  They could swim any distance under 
water, and every now and again, just as I was beginning to reckon 
myself safe, a cold hand would be laid on my ankle - ugh!
</p><p>However, my long sleep, troubled as it was, put me all right again, 
and I was able to work acceptably this morning and be very jolly 
all day.  This evening I have had a great deal of talk with both 
the Russian ladies; they talked very nicely, and are bright, 
likable women both.  They come from Georgia.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY, 10.30. - We have all been to tea to-night at the 
Russians' villa.  Tea was made out of a samovar, which is something 
like a small steam engine, and whose principal advantage is that it 
burns the fingers of all who lay their profane touch upon it.  
After tea Madame Z. played Russian airs, very plaintive and pretty; 
so the evening was Muscovite from beginning to end.  Madame G.'s 
daughter danced a tarantella, which was very pretty.
</p><p>Whenever Nelitchka cries - and she never cries except from pain - 
all that one has to do is to start 'Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre.'  
She cannot resist the attraction; she is drawn through her sobs 
into the air; and in a moment there is Nelly singing, with the glad 
look that comes into her face always when she sings, and all the 
tears and pain forgotten.
</p><p>It is wonderful, before I shut this up, how that child remains ever 
interesting to me.  Nothing can stale her infinite variety; and yet 
it is not very various.  You see her thinking what she is to do or 
to say next, with a funny grave air of reserve, and then the face 
breaks up into a smile, and it is probably 'Berecchino!' said with 
that sudden little jump of the voice that one knows in children, as 
the escape of a jack-in-the-box, and, somehow, I am quite happy

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[MENTONE, JANUARY 1874.]
</p><p>. . . LAST night I had a quarrel with the American on politics.  It 
is odd how it irritates you to hear certain political statements 
made.  He was excited, and he began suddenly to abuse our conduct 
to America.  I, of course, admitted right and left that we had 
behaved disgracefully (as we had); until somehow I got tired of 
turning alternate cheeks and getting duly buffeted; and when he 
said that the Alabama money had not wiped out the injury, I 
suggested, in language (I remember) of admirable directness and 
force, that it was a pity they had taken the money in that case.  
He lost his temper at once, and cried out that his dearest wish was 
a war with England; whereupon I also lost my temper, and, 
thundering at the pitch of my voice, I left him and went away by 
myself to another part of the garden.  A very tender reconciliation 
took place, and I think there will come no more harm out of it.  We 
are both of us nervous people, and he had had a very long walk and 
a good deal of beer at dinner:  that explains the scene a little.  
But I regret having employed so much of the voice with which I have 
been endowed, as I fear every person in the hotel was taken into 
confidence as to my sentiments, just at the very juncture when 
neither the sentiments nor (perhaps) the language had been 
sufficiently considered.
</p><p>FRIDAY. - You have not yet heard of my book? - FOUR GREAT SCOTSMEN 
- John Knox, David Hume, Robert Burns, Walter Scott.  These, their 
lives, their work, the social media in which they lived and worked, 
with, if I can so make it, the strong current of the race making 
itself felt underneath and throughout - this is my idea.  You must 
tell me what you think of it.  The Knox will really be new matter, 
as his life hitherto has been disgracefully written, and the events 
are romantic and rapid; the character very strong, salient, and 
worthy; much interest as to the future of Scotland, and as to that 
part of him which was truly modern under his Hebrew disguise.  
Hume, of course, the urbane, cheerful, gentlemanly, letter-writing 
eighteenth century, full of attraction, and much that I don't yet 
know as to his work.  Burns, the sentimental side that there is in 
most Scotsmen, his poor troubled existence, how far his poems were 
his personally, and how far national, the question of the framework 
of society in Scotland, and its fatal effect upon the finest 
natures.  Scott again, the ever delightful man, sane, courageous, 
admirable; the birth of Romance, in a dawn that was a sunset; 
snobbery, conservatism, the wrong thread in History, and notably in 
that of his own land.  VOILA, MADAME, LE MENU.  COMMENT LE TROUVEZ-
VOUS?  IL Y A DE LA BONNE VIANDO, SI ON PARVIENT A LA CUIRE 
CONVENABLEMENT.

</p><p>[MENTONE, MARCH 28, 1874.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - Beautiful weather, perfect weather; sun, pleasant 
cooling winds; health very good; only incapacity to write.
</p><p>The only new cloud on my horizon (I mean this in no menacing sense) 
is the Prince.  I have philosophical and artistic discussions with 
the Prince.  He is capable of talking for two hours upon end, 
developing his theory of everything under Heaven from his first 
position, which is that there is no straight line.  Doesn't that 
sound like a game of my father's - I beg your pardon, you haven't 
read it - I don't mean MY father, I mean Tristram Shandy's.  He is 
very clever, and it is an immense joke to hear him unrolling all 
the problems of life - philosophy, science, what you will - in this 
charmingly cut-and-dry, here-we-are-again kind of manner.  He is 
better to listen to than to argue withal.  When you differ from 
him, he lifts up his voice and thunders; and you know that the 
thunder of an excited foreigner often miscarries.  One stands 
aghast, marvelling how such a colossus of a man, in such a great 
commotion of spirit, can open his mouth so much and emit such a 
still small voice at the hinder end of it all.  All this while he 
walks about the room, smokes cigarettes, occupies divers chairs for 
divers brief spaces, and casts his huge arms to the four winds like 
the sails of a mill.  He is a most sportive Prince.

</p><p>[SWANSTON], MAY 1874, MONDAY.
</p><p>WE are now at Swanston Cottage, Lothianburn, Edinburgh.  The garden 
is but little clothed yet, for, you know, here we are six hundred 
feet above the sea.  It is very cold, and has sleeted this morning.  
Everything wintry.  I am very jolly, however, having finished 
Victor Hugo, and just looking round to see what I should next take 
up.  I have been reading Roman Law and Calvin this morning.
</p><p>EVENING. - I went up the hill a little this afternoon.  The air was 
invigorating, but it was so cold that my scalp was sore.  With this 
high wintry wind, and the grey sky, and faint northern daylight, it 
was quite wonderful to hear such a clamour of blackbirds coming up 
to me out of the woods, and the bleating of sheep being shorn in a 
field near the garden, and to see golden patches of blossom already 
on the furze, and delicate green shoots upright and beginning to 
frond out, among last year's russet bracken.  Flights of crows were 
passing continually between the wintry leaden sky and the wintry 
cold-looking hills.  It was the oddest conflict of seasons.  A wee 
rabbit - this year's making, beyond question - ran out from under 
my feet, and was in a pretty perturbation, until he hit upon a 
lucky juniper and blotted himself there promptly.  Evidently this 
gentleman had not had much experience of life.
</p><p>I have made an arrangement with my people:  I am to have 84 pounds 
a year - I only asked for 80 pounds on mature reflection - and as I 
should soon make a good bit by my pen, I shall be very comfortable.  
We are all as jolly as can be together, so that is a great thing 
gained.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY. - Yesterday I received a letter that gave me much 
pleasure from a poor fellow-student of mine, who has been all 
winter very ill, and seems to be but little better even now.  He 
seems very much pleased with ORDERED SOUTH.  'A month ago,' he 
says, 'I could scarcely have ventured to read it; to-day I felt on 
reading it as I did on the first day that I was able to sun myself 
a little in the open air.'  And much more to the like effect.  It 
is very gratifying. - Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SWANSTON, WEDNESDAY, MAY 1874.
</p><p>STRUGGLING away at FABLES IN SONG.  I am much afraid I am going to 
make a real failure; the time is so short, and I am so out of the 
humour.  Otherwise very calm and jolly:  cold still IMPOSSIBLE.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - I feel happier about the FABLES, and it is warmer a 
bit; but my body is most decrepit, and I can just manage to be 
cheery and tread down hypochondria under foot by work.  I lead such 
a funny life, utterly without interest or pleasure outside of my 
work:  nothing, indeed, but work all day long, except a short walk 
alone on the cold hills, and meals, and a couple of pipes with my 
father in the evening.  It is surprising how it suits me, and how 
happy I keep.
</p><p>SATURDAY. - I have received such a nice long letter (four sides) 
from Leslie Stephen to-day about my Victor Hugo.  It is accepted.  
This ought to have made me gay, but it hasn't.  I am not likely to 
be much of a tonic to-night.  I have been very cynical over myself 
to-day, partly, perhaps, because I have just finished some of the 
deedest rubbish about Lord Lytton's fables that an intelligent 
editor ever shot into his wastepaper basket.  If Morley prints it I 
shall be glad, but my respect for him will be shaken.
</p><p>TUESDAY. - Another cold day; yet I have been along the hillside, 
wondering much at idiotic sheep, and raising partridges at every 
second step.  One little plover is the object of my firm adherence.  
I pass his nest every day, and if you saw how he files by me, and 
almost into my face, crying and flapping his wings, to direct my 
attention from his little treasure, you would have as kind a heart 
to him as I.  To-day I saw him not, although I took my usual way; 
and I am afraid that some person has abused his simple wiliness and 
harried (as we say in Scotland) the nest.  I feel much righteous 
indignation against such imaginary aggressor.  However, one must 
not be too chary of the lower forms.  To-day I sat down on a tree-
stump at the skirt of a little strip of planting, and thoughtlessly 
began to dig out the touchwood with an end of twig.  I found I had 
carried ruin, death, and universal consternation into a little 
community of ants; and this set me a-thinking of how close we are 
environed with frail lives, so that we can do nothing without 
spreading havoc over all manner of perishable homes and interests 
and affections; and so on to my favourite mood of an holy terror 
for all action and all inaction equally - a sort of shuddering 
revulsion from the necessary responsibilities of life.  We must not 
be too scrupulous of others, or we shall die.  Conscientiousness is 
a sort of moral opium; an excitant in small doses, perhaps, but at 
bottom a strong narcotic.
</p><p>SATURDAY. - I have been two days in Edinburgh, and so had not the 
occasion to write to you.  Morley has accepted the FABLES, and I 
have seen it in proof, and think less of it than ever.  However, of 
course, I shall send you a copy of the MAGAZINE without fail, and 
you can be as disappointed as you like, or the reverse if you can.  
I would willingly recall it if I could.
</p><p>Try, by way of change, Byron's MAZEPPA; you will be astonished.  It 
is grand and no mistake, and one sees through it a fire, and a 
passion, and a rapid intuition of genius, that makes one rather 
sorry for one's own generation of better writers, and - I don't 
know what to say; I was going to say 'smaller men'; but that's not 
right; read it, and you will feel what I cannot express.  Don't be 
put out by the beginning; persevere, and you will find yourself 
thrilled before you are at an end with it. - Ever your faithful 
friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TRAIN BETWEEN EDINBURGH AND CHESTER, AUGUST 8, 1874.
</p><p>MY father and mother reading.  I think I shall talk to you for a 
moment or two.  This morning at Swanston, the birds, poor 
creatures, had the most troubled hour or two; evidently there was a 
hawk in the neighbourhood; not one sang; and the whole garden 
thrilled with little notes of warning and terror.  I did not know 
before that the voice of birds could be so tragically expressive.  
I had always heard them before express their trivial satisfaction 
with the blue sky and the return of daylight.  Really, they almost 
frightened me; I could hear mothers and wives in terror for those 
who were dear to them; it was easy to translate, I wish it were as 
easy to write; but it is very hard in this flying train, or I would 
write you more.
</p><p>CHESTER. - I like this place much; but somehow I feel glad when I 
get among the quiet eighteenth century buildings, in cosy places 
with some elbow room about them, after the older architecture.  
This other is bedevilled and furtive; it seems to stoop; I am 
afraid of trap-doors, and could not go pleasantly into such houses.  
I don't know how much of this is legitimately the effect of the 
architecture; little enough possibly; possibly far the most part of 
it comes from bad historical novels and the disquieting statuary 
that garnishes some facades.
</p><p>On the way, to-day, I passed through my dear Cumberland country.  
Nowhere to as great a degree can one find the combination of 
lowland and highland beauties; the outline of the blue hills is 
broken by the outline of many tumultuous tree-clumps; and the broad 
spaces of moorland are balanced by a network of deep hedgerows that 
might rival Suffolk, in the foreground. - How a railway journey 
shakes and discomposes one, mind and body!  I grow blacker and 
blacker in humour as the day goes on; and when at last I am let 
out, and have the fresh air about me, it is as though I were born 
again, and the sick fancies flee away from my mind like swans in 
spring.
</p><p>I want to come back on what I have said about eighteenth century 
and middle-age houses:  I do not know if I have yet explained to 
you the sort of loyalty, of urbanity, that there is about the one 
to my mind; the spirit of a country orderly and prosperous, a 
flavour of the presence of magistrates and well-to-do merchants in 
bag-wigs, the clink of glasses at night in fire-lit parlours, 
something certain and civic and domestic, is all about these quiet, 
staid, shapely houses, with no character but their exceeding 
shapeliness, and the comely external utterance that they make of 
their internal comfort.  Now the others are, as I have said, both 
furtive and bedevilled; they are sly and grotesque; they combine 
their sort of feverish grandeur with their sort of secretive 
baseness, after the manner of a Charles the Ninth.  They are 
peopled for me with persons of the same fashion.  Dwarfs and 
sinister people in cloaks are about them; and I seem to divine 
crypts, and, as I said, trap-doors.  O God be praised that we live 
in this good daylight and this good peace.
</p><p>BARMOUTH, AUGUST 9TH. - To-day we saw the cathedral at Chester; 
and, far more delightful, saw and heard a certain inimitable verger 
who took us round.  He was full of a certain recondite, far-away 
humour that did not quite make you laugh at the time, but was 
somehow laughable to recollect.  Moreover, he had so far a just 
imagination, and could put one in the right humour for seeing an 
old place, very much as, according to my favourite text, Scott's 
novels and poems do for one.  His account of the monks in the 
Scriptorium, with their cowls over their heads, in a certain 
sheltered angle of the cloister where the big Cathedral building 
kept the sun off the parchments, was all that could be wished; and 
so too was what he added of the others pacing solemnly behind them 
and dropping, ever and again, on their knees before a little shrine 
there is in the wall, 'to keep 'em in the frame of mind.'  You will 
begin to think me unduly biassed in this verger's favour if I go on 
to tell you his opinion of me.  We got into a little side chapel, 
whence we could hear the choir children at practice, and I stopped 
a moment listening to them, with, I dare say, a very bright face, 
for the sound was delightful to me.  'Ah,' says he, 'you're VERY 
fond of music.'  I said I was.  'Yes, I could tell that by your 
head,' he answered.  'There's a deal in that head.'  And he shook 
his own solemnly.  I said it might be so, but I found it hard, at 
least, to get it out.  Then my father cut in brutally, said anyway 
I had no ear, and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the 
foundations of his creed that, I hear, he got my father aside 
afterwards and said he was sure there was something in my face, and 
wanted to know what it was, if not music.  He was relieved when he 
heard that I occupied myself with litterature (which word, note 
here, I do not spell correctly).  Good-night, and here's the 
verger's health!

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SWANSTON, WEDNESDAY, [AUTUMN] 1874.
</p><p>I HAVE been hard at work all yesterday, and besides had to write a 
long letter to Bob, so I found no time until quite late, and then 
was sleepy.  Last night it blew a fearful gale; I was kept awake 
about a couple of hours, and could not get to sleep for the horror 
of the wind's noise; the whole house shook; and, mind you, our 
house IS a house, a great castle of jointed stone that would weigh 
up a street of English houses; so that when it quakes, as it did 
last night, it means something.  But the quaking was not what put 
me about; it was the horrible howl of the wind round the corner; 
the audible haunting of an incarnate anger about the house; the 
evil spirit that was abroad; and, above all, the shuddering silent 
pauses when the storm's heart stands dreadfully still for a moment.  
O how I hate a storm at night!  They have been a great influence in 
my life, I am sure; for I can remember them so far back - long 
before I was six at least, for we left the house in which I 
remember listening to them times without number when I was six.  
And in those days the storm had for me a perfect impersonation, as 
durable and unvarying as any heathen deity.  I always heard it, as 
a horseman riding past with his cloak about his head, and somehow 
always carried away, and riding past again, and being baffled yet 
once more, AD INFINITUM, all night long.  I think I wanted him to 
get past, but I am not sure; I know only that I had some interest 
either for or against in the matter; and I used to lie and hold my 
breath, not quite frightened, but in a state of miserable 
exaltation.
</p><p>My first John Knox is in proof, and my second is on the anvil.  It 
is very good of me so to do; for I want so much to get to my real 
tour and my sham tour, the real tour first:  it is always working 
in my head, and if I can only turn on the right sort of style at 
the right moment, I am not much afraid of it.  One thing bothers 
me; what with hammering at this J. K., and writing necessary 
letters, and taking necessary exercise (that even not enough, the 
weather is so repulsive to me, cold and windy), I find I have no 
time for reading except times of fatigue, when I wish merely to 
relax myself.  O - and I read over again for this purpose 
Flaubert's TENTATION DE ST. ANTOINE; it struck me a good deal at 
first, but this second time it has fetched me immensely.  I am but 
just done with it, so you will know the large proportion of salt to 
take with my present statement, that it's the finest thing I ever 
read!  Of course, it isn't that, it's full of LONGUEURS, and is not 
quite 'redd up,' as we say in Scotland, not quite articulated; but 
there are splendid things in it.
</p><p>I say, DO take your maccaroni with oil:  DO, PLEASE.  It's BEASTLY 
with butter. - Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH], DECEMBER 23, 1874.
</p><p>MONDAY. - I have come from a concert, and the concert was rather a 
disappointment.  Not so my afternoon skating - Duddingston, our big 
loch, is bearing; and I wish you could have seen it this afternoon, 
covered with people, in thin driving snow flurries, the big hill 
grim and white and alpine overhead in the thick air, and the road 
up the gorge, as it were into the heart of it, dotted black with 
traffic.  Moreover, I CAN skate a little bit; and what one can do 
is always pleasant to do.
</p><p>TUESDAY. - I got your letter to-day, and was so glad thereof.  It 
was of good omen to me also.  I worked from ten to one (my classes 
are suspended now for Xmas holidays), and wrote four or five 
Portfolio pages of my Buckinghamshire affair.  Then I went to 
Duddingston and skated all afternoon.  If you had seen the moon 
rising, a perfect sphere of smoky gold, in the dark air above the 
trees, and the white loch thick with skaters, and the great hill, 
snow-sprinkled, overhead!  It was a sight for a king.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY. - I stayed on Duddingston to-day till after nightfall.  
The little booths that hucksters set up round the edge were marked 
each one by its little lamp.  There were some fires too; and the 
light, and the shadows of the people who stood round them to warm 
themselves, made a strange pattern all round on the snow-covered 
ice.  A few people with torches began to travel up and down the 
ice, a lit circle travelling along with them over the snow.  A 
gigantic moon rose, meanwhile, over the trees and the kirk on the 
promontory, among perturbed and vacillating clouds.
</p><p>The walk home was very solemn and strange.  Once, through a broken 
gorge, we had a glimpse of a little space of mackerel sky, moon-
litten, on the other side of the hill; the broken ridges standing 
grey and spectral between; and the hilltop over all, snow-white, 
and strangely magnified in size.
</p><p>This must go to you to-morrow, so that you may read it on Christmas 
Day for company.  I hope it may be good company to you.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - Outside, it snows thick and steadily.  The gardens 
before our house are now a wonderful fairy forest.  And O, this 
whiteness of things, how I love it, how it sends the blood about my 
body!  Maurice de Guerin hated snow; what a fool he must have been!  
Somebody tried to put me out of conceit with it by saying that 
people were lost in it.  As if people don't get lost in love, too, 
and die of devotion to art; as if everything worth were not an 
occasion to some people's end.
</p><p>What a wintry letter this is!  Only I think it is winter seen from 
the inside of a warm greatcoat.  And there is, at least, a warm 
heart about it somewhere.  Do you know, what they say in Xmas 
stories is true?  I think one loves their friends more dearly at 
this season. - Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROAD, EDINBURGH [JANUARY 1875].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I have worked too hard; I have given myself one 
day of rest, and that was not enough; I am giving myself another.  
I shall go to bed again likewise so soon as this is done, and 
slumber most potently.
</p><p>9 P.M., slept all afternoon like a lamb.
</p><p>About my coming south, I think the still small unanswerable voice 
of coins will make it impossible until the session is over (end of 
March); but for all that, I think I shall hold out jolly.  I do not 
want you to come and bother yourself; indeed, it is still not quite 
certain whether my father will be quite fit for you, although I 
have now no fear of that really.  Now don't take up this wrongly; I 
wish you could come; and I do not know anything that would make me 
happier, but I see that it is wrong to expect it, and so I resign 
myself:  some time after.  I offered Appleton a series of papers on 
the modern French school - the Parnassiens, I think they call them 
- de Banville, Coppee, Soulary, and Sully Prudhomme.  But he has 
not deigned to answer my letter.
</p><p>I shall have another Portfolio paper so soon as I am done with this 
story, that has played me out; the story is to be called WHEN THE 
DEVIL WAS WELL:  scene, Italy, Renaissance; colour, purely 
imaginary of course, my own unregenerate idea of what Italy then 
was.  O, when shall I find the story of my dreams, that shall never 
halt nor wander nor step aside, but go ever before its face, and 
ever swifter and louder, until the pit receives it, roaring?  The 
Portfolio paper will be about Scotland and England. - Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>EDINBURGH, TUESDAY [FEBRUARY 1875].
</p><p>I GOT your nice long gossiping letter to-day - I mean by that that 
there was more news in it than usual - and so, of course, I am 
pretty jolly.  I am in the house, however, with such a beastly cold 
in the head.  Our east winds begin already to be very cold.
</p><p>O, I have such a longing for children of my own; and yet I do not 
think I could bear it if I had one.  I fancy I must feel more like 
a woman than like a man about that.  I sometimes hate the children 
I see on the street - you know what I mean by hate - wish they were 
somewhere else, and not there to mock me; and sometimes, again, I 
don't know how to go by them for the love of them, especially the 
very wee ones.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - I have been still in the house since I wrote, and I 
HAVE worked.  I finished the Italian story; not well, but as well 
as I can just now; I must go all over it again, some time soon, 
when I feel in the humour to better and perfect it.  And now I have 
taken up an old story, begun years ago; and I have now re-written 
all I had written of it then, and mean to finish it.  What I have 
lost and gained is odd.  As far as regards simple writing, of 
course, I am in another world now; but in some things, though more 
clumsy, I seem to have been freer and more plucky:  this is a 
lesson I have taken to heart.  I have got a jolly new name for my 
old story.  I am going to call it A COUNTRY DANCE; the two heroes 
keep changing places, you know; and the chapter where the most of 
this changing goes on is to be called 'Up the middle, down the 
middle.'  It will be in six, or (perhaps) seven chapters.  I have 
never worked harder in my life than these last four days.  If I can 
only keep it up.
</p><p>SATURDAY. - Yesterday, Leslie Stephen, who was down here to 
lecture, called on me and took me up to see a poor fellow, a poet 
who writes for him, and who has been eighteen months in our 
infirmary, and may be, for all I know, eighteen months more.  It 
was very sad to see him there, in a little room with two beds, and 
a couple of sick children in the other bed; a girl came in to visit 
the children, and played dominoes on the counterpane with them; the 
gas flared and crackled, the fire burned in a dull economical way; 
Stephen and I sat on a couple of chairs, and the poor fellow sat up 
in his bed with his hair and beard all tangled, and talked as 
cheerfully as if he had been in a King's palace, or the great 
King's palace of the blue air.  He has taught himself two languages 
since he has been lying there.  I shall try to be of use to him.
</p><p>We have had two beautiful spring days, mild as milk, windy withal, 
and the sun hot.  I dreamed last night I was walking by moonlight 
round the place where the scene of my story is laid; it was all so 
quiet and sweet, and the blackbirds were singing as if it was day; 
it made my heart very cool and happy. - Ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>FEBRUARY 8, 1875.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Forgive my bothering you.  Here is the proof of 
my second KNOX.  Glance it over, like a good fellow, and if there's 
anything very flagrant send it to me marked.  I have no confidence 
in myself; I feel such an ass.  What have I been doing?  As near as 
I can calculate, nothing.  And yet I have worked all this month 
from three to five hours a day, that is to say, from one to three 
hours more than my doctor allows me; positively no result.
</p><p>No, I can write no article just now; I am PIOCHING, like a madman, 
at my stories, and can make nothing of them; my simplicity is tame 
and dull - my passion tinsel, boyish, hysterical.  Never mind - ten 
years hence, if I live, I shall have learned, so help me God.  I 
know one must work, in the meantime (so says Balzac) COMME LE 
MINEUR ENFOUI SOUS UN EBOULEMENT.
</p><p>J'Y PARVIENDRAI, NOM DE NOM DE NOM!  But it's a long look forward.

</p><p>[BARBIZON, APRIL 1875.]
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - This is just a line to say I am well and happy.  
I am here in my dear forest all day in the open air.  It is very be 
- no, not beautiful exactly, just now, but very bright and living.  
There are one or two song birds and a cuckoo; all the fruit-trees 
are in flower, and the beeches make sunshine in a shady place, I 
begin to go all right; you need not be vexed about my health; I 
really was ill at first, as bad as I have been for nearly a year; 
but the forest begins to work, and the air, and the sun, and the 
smell of the pines.  If I could stay a month here, I should be as 
right as possible.  Thanks for your letter. - Your faithful
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH, SUNDAY [APRIL 1875].
</p><p>HERE is my long story:  yesterday night, after having supped, I 
grew so restless that I was obliged to go out in search of some 
excitement.  There was a half-moon lying over on its back, and 
incredibly bright in the midst of a faint grey sky set with faint 
stars:  a very inartistic moon, that would have damned a picture.
</p><p>At the most populous place of the city I found a little boy, three 
years old perhaps, half frantic with terror, and crying to every 
one for his 'Mammy.'  This was about eleven, mark you.  People 
stopped and spoke to him, and then went on, leaving him more 
frightened than before.  But I and a good-humoured mechanic came up 
together; and I instantly developed a latent faculty for setting 
the hearts of children at rest.  Master Tommy Murphy (such was his 
name) soon stopped crying, and allowed me to take him up and carry 
him; and the mechanic and I trudged away along Princes Street to 
find his parents.  I was soon so tired that I had to ask the 
mechanic to carry the bairn; and you should have seen the puzzled 
contempt with which he looked at me, for knocking in so soon.  He 
was a good fellow, however, although very impracticable and 
sentimental; and he soon bethought him that Master Murphy might 
catch cold after his excitement, so we wrapped him up in my 
greatcoat.  'Tobauga (Tobago) Street' was the address he gave us; 
and we deposited him in a little grocer's shop and went through all 
the houses in the street without being able to find any one of the 
name of Murphy.  Then I set off to the head police office, leaving 
my greatcoat in pawn about Master Murphy's person.  As I went down 
one of the lowest streets in the town, I saw a little bit of life 
that struck me.  It was now half-past twelve, a little shop stood 
still half-open, and a boy of four or five years old was walking up 
and down before it imitating cockcrow.  He was the only living 
creature within sight.
</p><p>At the police offices no word of Master Murphy's parents; so I went 
back empty-handed.  The good groceress, who had kept her shop open 
all this time, could keep the child no longer; her father, bad with 
bronchitis, said he must forth.  So I got a large scone with 
currants in it, wrapped my coat about Tommy, got him up on my arm, 
and away to the police office with him:  not very easy in my mind, 
for the poor child, young as he was - he could scarce speak - was 
full of terror for the 'office,' as he called it.  He was now very 
grave and quiet and communicative with me; told me how his father 
thrashed him, and divers household matters.  Whenever he saw a 
woman on our way he looked after her over my shoulder and then gave 
his judgment:  'That's no HER,' adding sometimes, 'She has a wean 
wi' her.'  Meantime I was telling him how I was going to take him 
to a gentleman who would find out his mother for him quicker than 
ever I could, and how he must not be afraid of him, but be brave, 
as he had been with me.  We had just arrived at our destination - 
we were just under the lamp - when he looked me in the face and 
said appealingly, 'He'll no put - me in the office?'  And I had to 
assure him that he would not, even as I pushed open the door and 
took him in.
</p><p>The serjeant was very nice, and I got Tommy comfortably seated on a 
bench, and spirited him up with good words and the scone with the 
currants in it; and then, telling him I was just going out to look 
for Mammy, I got my greatcoat and slipped away.
</p><p>Poor little boy! he was not called for, I learn, until ten this 
morning.  This is very ill written, and I've missed half that was 
picturesque in it; but to say truth, I am very tired and sleepy:  
it was two before I got to bed.  However, you see, I had my 
excitement.
</p><p>MONDAY. - I have written nothing all morning; I cannot settle to 
it.  Yes - I WILL though.
</p><p>10.45. - And I did.  I want to say something more to you about the 
three women.  I wonder so much why they should have been WOMEN, and 
halt between two opinions in the matter.  Sometimes I think it is 
because they were made by a man for men; sometimes, again, I think 
there is an abstract reason for it, and there is something more 
substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man.  I 
can conceive a great mythical woman, living alone among 
inaccessible mountain-tops or in some lost island in the pagan 
seas, and ask no more.  Whereas if I hear of a Hercules, I ask 
after Iole or Dejanira.  I cannot think him a man without women.  
But I can think of these three deep-breasted women, living out all 
their days on remote hilltops, seeing the white dawn and the purple 
even, and the world outspread before them for ever, and no more to 
them for ever than a sight of the eyes, a hearing of the ears, a 
far-away interest of the inflexible heart, not pausing, not 
pitying, but austere with a holy austerity, rigid with a calm and 
passionless rigidity; and I find them none the less women to the 
end.
</p><p>And think, if one could love a woman like that once, see her once 
grow pale with passion, and once wring your lips out upon hers, 
would it not be a small thing to die?  Not that there is not a 
passion of a quite other sort, much less epic, far more dramatic 
and intimate, that comes out of the very frailty of perishable 
women; out of the lines of suffering that we see written about 
their eyes, and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment; 
out of the thin hands, wrought and tempered in agony to a fineness 
of perception, that the indifferent or the merely happy cannot 
know; out of the tragedy that lies about such a love, and the 
pathetic incompleteness.  This is another thing, and perhaps it is 
a higher.  I look over my shoulder at the three great headless 
Madonnas, and they look back at me and do not move; see me, and 
through and over me, the foul life of the city dying to its embers 
already as the night draws on; and over miles and miles of silent 
country, set here and there with lit towns, thundered through here 
and there with night expresses scattering fire and smoke; and away 
to the ends of the earth, and the furthest star, and the blank 
regions of nothing; and they are not moved.  My quiet, great-kneed, 
deep-breasted, well-draped ladies of Necessity, I give my heart to 
you!

</p><p>[SWANSTON, TUESDAY, APRIL 1875.]
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - I have been so busy, away to Bridge Of Allan with 
my father first, and then with Simpson and Baxter out here from 
Saturday till Monday.  I had no time to write, and, as it is, am 
strangely incapable.  Thanks for your letter.  I have been reading 
such lots of law, and it seems to take away the power of writing 
from me.  From morning to night, so often as I have a spare moment, 
I am in the embrace of a law book - barren embraces.  I am in good 
spirits; and my heart smites me as usual, when I am in good 
spirits, about my parents.  If I get a bit dull, I am away to 
London without a scruple; but so long as my heart keeps up, I am 
all for my parents.
</p><p>What do you think of Henley's hospital verses?  They were to have 
been dedicated to me, but Stephen wouldn't allow it - said it would 
be pretentious.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY. - I meant to have made this quite a decent letter this 
morning, but listen.  I had pain all last night, and did not sleep 
well, and now am cold and sickish, and strung up ever and again 
with another flash of pain.  Will you remember me to everybody?  My 
principal characteristics are cold, poverty, and Scots Law - three 
very bad things.  Oo, how the rain falls!  The mist is quite low on 
the hill.  The birds are twittering to each other about the 
indifferent season.  O, here's a gem for you.  An old godly woman 
predicted the end of the world, because the seasons were becoming 
indistinguishable; my cousin Dora objected that last winter had 
been pretty well marked.  'Yes, my dear,' replied the 
soothsayeress; 'but I think you'll find the summer will be rather 
coamplicated.' - Ever your faithful

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, SATURDAY, APRIL 1875.]
</p><p>I AM getting on with my rehearsals, but I find the part very hard.  
I rehearsed yesterday from a quarter to seven, and to-day from four 
(with interval for dinner) to eleven.  You see the sad strait I am 
in for ink. - A DEMAIN.
</p><p>SUNDAY. - This is the third ink-bottle I have tried, and still it's 
nothing to boast of.  My journey went off all right, and I have 
kept ever in good spirits.  Last night, indeed, I did think my 
little bit of gaiety was going away down the wind like a whiff of 
tobacco smoke, but to-day it has come back to me a little.  The 
influence of this place is assuredly all that can be worst against 
one; MAIL IL FAUT LUTTER.  I was haunted last night when I was in 
bed by the most cold, desolate recollections of my past life here; 
I was glad to try and think of the forest, and warm my hands at the 
thought of it.  O the quiet, grey thickets, and the yellow 
butterflies, and the woodpeckers, and the outlook over the plain as 
it were over a sea!  O for the good, fleshly stupidity of the 
woods, the body conscious of itself all over and the mind 
forgotten, the clean air nestling next your skin as though your 
clothes were gossamer, the eye filled and content, the whole MAN 
HAPPY!  Whereas here it takes a pull to hold yourself together; it 
needs both hands, and a book of stoical maxims, and a sort of 
bitterness at the heart by way of armour. - Ever your faithful
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>WEDNESDAY. - I am so played out with a cold in my eye that I cannot 
see to write or read without difficulty.  It is swollen HORRIBLE; 
so how I shall look as Orsino, God knows!  I have my fine clothes 
tho'.  Henley's sonnets have been taken for the CORNHILL.  He is 
out of hospital now, and dressed, but still not too much to brag of 
in health, poor fellow, I am afraid.
</p><p>SUNDAY. - So.  I have still rather bad eyes, and a nasty sore 
throat.  I play Orsino every day, in all the pomp of Solomon, 
splendid Francis the First clothes, heavy with gold and stage 
jewellery.  I play it ill enough, I believe; but me and the 
clothes, and the wedding wherewith the clothes and me are 
reconciled, produce every night a thrill of admiration.  Our cook 
told my mother (there is a servants' night, you know) that she and 
the housemaid were 'just prood to be able to say it was oor young 
gentleman.'  To sup afterwards with these clothes on, and a 
wonderful lot of gaiety and Shakespearean jokes about the table, is 
something to live for.  It is so nice to feel you have been dead 
three hundred years, and the sound of your laughter is faint and 
far off in the centuries. - Ever your faithful
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p><br />
WEDNESDAY. - A moment at last.  These last few days have been as 
jolly as days could be, and by good fortune I leave to-morrow for 
Swanston, so that I shall not feel the whole fall back to habitual 
self.  The pride of life could scarce go further.  To live in 
splendid clothes, velvet and gold and fur, upon principally 
champagne and lobster salad, with a company of people nearly all of 
whom are exceptionally good talkers; when your days began about 
eleven and ended about four - I have lost that sentence; I give it 
up; it is very admirable sport, any way.  Then both my afternoons 
have been so pleasantly occupied - taking Henley drives.  I had a 
business to carry him down the long stair, and more of a business 
to get him up again, but while he was in the carriage it was 
splendid.  It is now just the top of spring with us.  The whole 
country is mad with green.  To see the cherry-blossom bitten out 
upon the black firs, and the black firs bitten out of the blue sky, 
was a sight to set before a king.  You may imagine what it was to a 
man who has been eighteen months in an hospital ward.  The look of 
his face was a wine to me.
</p><p>I shall send this off to-day to let you know of my new address - 
Swanston Cottage, Lothianburn, Edinburgh.  Salute the faithful in 
my name.  Salute Priscilla, salute Barnabas, salute Ebenezer - O 
no, he's too much, I withdraw Ebenezer; enough of early Christians. 
- Ever your faithful
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>[EDINBURGH, JUNE 1875.]
</p><p>SIMPLY a scratch.  All right, jolly, well, and through with the 
difficulty.  My father pleased about the Burns.  Never travel in 
the same carriage with three able-bodied seamen and a fruiterer 
from Kent; the A.-B.'s speak all night as though they were hailing 
vessels at sea; and the fruiterer as if he were crying fruit in a 
noisy market-place - such, at least, is my FUNESTE experience.  I 
wonder if a fruiterer from some place else - say Worcestershire - 
would offer the same phenomena? insoluble doubt.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>Later. - Forgive me, couldn't get it off.  Awfully nice man here 
to-night.  Public servant - New Zealand.  Telling us all about the 
South Sea Islands till I was sick with desire to go there:  
beautiful places, green for ever; perfect climate; perfect shapes 
of men and women, with red flowers in their hair; and nothing to do 
but to study oratory and etiquette, sit in the sun, and pick up the 
fruits as they fall.  Navigator's Island is the place; absolute 
balm for the weary. - Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SWANSTON.  END OF JUNE, 1875.
</p><p>THURSDAY. - This day fortnight I shall fall or conquer.  Outside 
the rain still soaks; but now and again the hilltop looks through 
the mist vaguely.  I am very comfortable, very sleepy, and very 
much satisfied with the arrangements of Providence.
</p><p>SATURDAY - NO, SUNDAY, 12.45. - Just been - not grinding, alas! - I 
couldn't - but doing a bit of Fontainebleau.  I don't think I'll be 
plucked.  I am not sure though - I am so busy, what with this d-d 
law, and this Fontainebleau always at my elbow, and three plays 
(three, think of that!) and a story, all crying out to me, 'Finish, 
finish, make an entire end, make us strong, shapely, viable 
creatures!'  It's enough to put a man crazy.  Moreover, I have my 
thesis given out now, which is a fifth (is it fifth? I can't count) 
incumbrance.
</p><p>SUNDAY. - I've been to church, and am not depressed - a great step.  
I was at that beautiful church my PETIT POEME EN PROSE was about.  
It is a little cruciform place, with heavy cornices and string 
course to match, and a steep slate roof.  The small kirkyard is 
full of old grave-stones.  One of a Frenchman from Dunkerque - I 
suppose he died prisoner in the military prison hard by - and one, 
the most pathetic memorial I ever saw, a poor school-slate, in a 
wooden frame, with the inscription cut into it evidently by the 
father's own hand.  In church, old Mr. Torrence preached - over 
eighty, and a relic of times forgotten, with his black thread 
gloves and mild old foolish face.  One of the nicest parts of it 
was to see John Inglis, the greatest man in Scotland, our Justice-
General, and the only born lawyer I ever heard, listening to the 
piping old body, as though it had all been a revelation, grave and 
respectful. - Ever your faithful
</p><p>R. L. S.
