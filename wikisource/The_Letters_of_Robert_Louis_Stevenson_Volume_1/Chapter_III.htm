Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHEZ SIRON, BARBIZON, SEINE ET MARNE, AUGUST 1875.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I have been three days at a place called Grez, a 
pretty and very melancholy village on the plain.  A low bridge of 
many arches choked with sedge; great fields of white and yellow 
water-lilies; poplars and willows innumerable; and about it all 
such an atmosphere of sadness and slackness, one could do nothing 
but get into the boat and out of it again, and yawn for bedtime.
</p><p>Yesterday Bob and I walked home; it came on a very creditable 
thunderstorm; we were soon wet through; sometimes the rain was so 
heavy that one could only see by holding the hand over the eyes; 
and to crown all, we lost our way and wandered all over the place, 
and into the artillery range, among broken trees, with big shot 
lying about among the rocks.  It was near dinner-time when we got 
to Barbizon; and it is supposed that we walked from twenty-three to 
twenty-five miles, which is not bad for the Advocate, who is not 
tired this morning.  I was very glad to be back again in this dear 
place, and smell the wet forest in the morning.
</p><p>Simpson and the rest drove back in a carriage, and got about as wet 
as we did.
</p><p>Why don't you write?  I have no more to say. - Ever your 
affectionate son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHATEAU RENARD, LOIRET, AUGUST 1875.
</p><p>. . . I HAVE been walking these last days from place to place; and 
it does make it hot for walking with a sack in this weather.  I am 
burned in horrid patches of red; my nose, I fear, is going to take 
the lead in colour; Simpson is all flushed, as if he were seen by a 
sunset.  I send you here two rondeaux; I don't suppose they will 
amuse anybody but me; but this measure, short and yet intricate, is 
just what I desire; and I have had some good times walking along 
the glaring roads, or down the poplar alley of the great canal, 
pitting my own humour to this old verse.
</p><p><br />
Far have you come, my lady, from the town,
And far from all your sorrows, if you please,
To smell the good sea-winds and hear the seas,
And in green meadows lay your body down.
</p><p>To find your pale face grow from pale to brown,
Your sad eyes growing brighter by degrees;
Far have you come, my lady, from the town,
And far from all your sorrows, if you please.
</p><p>Here in this seaboard land of old renown,
In meadow grass go wading to the knees;
Bathe your whole soul a while in simple ease;
There is no sorrow but the sea can drown;
Far have you come, my lady, from the town.
</p><p><br />
NOUS N'IRONS PLUS AU BOIS.
</p><p><br />
We'll walk the woods no more,
But stay beside the fire,
To weep for old desire
And things that are no more.
</p><p>The woods are spoiled and hoar,
The ways are full of mire;
We'll walk the woods no more,
But stay beside the fire.
We loved, in days of yore,
Love, laughter, and the lyre.
Ah God, but death is dire,
And death is at the door -
We'll walk the woods no more.
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>EDINBURGH, [AUTUMN] 1875.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Thanks for your letter and news.  No - my BURNS 
is not done yet, it has led me so far afield that I cannot finish 
it; every time I think I see my way to an end, some new game (or 
perhaps wild goose) starts up, and away I go.  And then, again, to 
be plain, I shirk the work of the critical part, shirk it as a man 
shirks a long jump.  It is awful to have to express and 
differentiate BURNS in a column or two.  O golly, I say, you know, 
it CAN'T be done at the money.  All the more as I'm going write a 
book about it.  RAMSAY, FERGUSSON, AND BURNS:  AN ESSAY (or A 
CRITICAL ESSAY? but then I'm going to give lives of the three 
gentlemen, only the gist of the book is the criticism) BY ROBERT 
LOUIS STEVENSON, ADVOCATE.  How's that for cut and dry?  And I 
COULD write this book.  Unless I deceive myself, I could even write 
it pretty adequately.  I feel as if I was really in it, and knew 
the game thoroughly.  You see what comes of trying to write an 
essay on BURNS in ten columns.
</p><p>Meantime, when I have done Burns, I shall finish Charles of Orleans 
(who is in a good way, about the fifth month, I should think, and 
promises to be a fine healthy child, better than any of his elder 
brothers for a while); and then perhaps a Villon, for Villon is a 
very essential part of my RAMSAY-FERGUSSON-BURNS; I mean, is a note 
in it, and will recur again and again for comparison and 
illustration; then, perhaps, I may try Fontainebleau, by the way.  
But so soon as Charles of Orleans is polished off, and immortalised 
for ever, he and his pipings, in a solid imperishable shrine of R. 
L. S., my true aim and end will be this little book.  Suppose I 
could jerk you out 100 Cornhill pages; that would easy make 200 
pages of decent form; and then thickish paper - eh? would that do?  
I dare say it could be made bigger; but I know what 100 pages of 
copy, bright consummate copy, imply behind the scenes of weary 
manuscribing; I think if I put another nothing to it, I should not 
be outside the mark; and 100 Cornhill pages of 500 words means, I 
fancy (but I never was good at figures), means 500,00 words.  
There's a prospect for an idle young gentleman who lives at home at 
ease!  The future is thick with inky fingers.  And then perhaps 
nobody would publish.  AH NOM DE DIEU!  What do you think of all 
this? will it paddle, think you?
</p><p>I hope this pen will write; it is the third I have tried.
</p><p>About coming up, no, that's impossible; for I am worse than a 
bankrupt.  I have at the present six shillings and a penny; I have 
a sounding lot of bills for Christmas; new dress suit, for 
instance, the old one having gone for Parliament House; and new 
white shirts to live up to my new profession; I'm as gay and swell 
and gummy as can be; only all my boots leak; one pair water, and 
the other two simple black mud; so that my rig is more for the eye, 
than a very solid comfort to myself.  That is my budget.  Dismal 
enough, and no prospect of any coin coming in; at least for months.  
So that here I am, I almost fear, for the winter; certainly till 
after Christmas, and then it depends on how my bills 'turn out' 
whether it shall not be till spring.  So, meantime, I must whistle 
in my cage.  My cage is better by one thing; I am an Advocate now.  
If you ask me why that makes it better, I would remind you that in 
the most distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long 
way, and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence round the 
coffin.  I idle finely.  I read Boswell's LIFE OF JOHNSON, Martin's 
HISTORY OF FRANCE, ALLAN RAMSAY, OLIVIER BOSSELIN, all sorts of 
rubbish, APROPOS of BURNS, COMMINES, JUVENAL DES URSINS, etc.  I 
walk about the Parliament House five forenoons a week, in wig and 
gown; I have either a five or six mile walk, or an hour or two hard 
skating on the rink, every afternoon, without fail.
</p><p>I have not written much; but, like the seaman's parrot in the tale, 
I have thought a deal.  You have never, by the way, returned me 
either SPRING or BERANGER, which is certainly a d-d shame.  I 
always comforted myself with that when my conscience pricked me 
about a letter to you.  'Thus conscience' - O no, that's not 
appropriate in this connection. - Ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I say, is there any chance of your coming north this year?  Mind 
you that promise is now more respectable for age than is becoming.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, OCTOBER 1875.]
</p><p>NOO lyart leaves blaw ower the green,
Red are the bonny woods o' Dean,
An' here we're back in Embro, freen',
To pass the winter.
Whilk noo, wi' frosts afore, draws in,
An' snaws ahint her.
</p><p>I've seen's hae days to fricht us a',
The Pentlands poothered weel wi' snaw,
The ways half-smoored wi' liquid thaw,
An' half-congealin',
The snell an' scowtherin' norther blaw
Frae blae Brunteelan'.
</p><p>I've seen's been unco sweir to sally,
And at the door-cheeks daff an' dally,
Seen's daidle thus an' shilly-shally
For near a minute -
Sae cauld the wind blew up the valley,
The deil was in it! -
</p><p>Syne spread the silk an' tak the gate,
In blast an' blaudin' rain, deil hae't!
The hale toon glintin', stane an' slate,
Wi' cauld an' weet,
An' to the Court, gin we'se be late,
Bicker oor feet.
</p><p>And at the Court, tae, aft I saw
Whaur Advocates by twa an' twa
Gang gesterin' end to end the ha'
In weeg an' goon,
To crack o' what ye wull but Law
The hale forenoon.
</p><p>That muckle ha,' maist like a kirk,
I've kent at braid mid-day sae mirk
Ye'd seen white weegs an' faces lurk
Like ghaists frae Hell,
But whether Christian ghaist or Turk
Deil ane could tell.
</p><p>The three fires lunted in the gloom,
The wind blew like the blast o' doom,
The rain upo' the roof abune
Played Peter Dick -
Ye wad nae'd licht enough i' the room
Your teeth to pick!
</p><p>But, freend, ye ken how me an' you,
The ling-lang lanely winter through,
Keep'd a guid speerit up, an' true
To lore Horatian,
We aye the ither bottle drew
To inclination.
</p><p>Sae let us in the comin' days
Stand sicker on our auncient ways -
The strauchtest road in a' the maze
Since Eve ate apples;
An' let the winter weet our cla'es -
We'll weet oor thrapples.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, AUTUMN 1875.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - FOUS NE ME GOMBRENNEZ PAS.  Angry with you?  No.  
Is the thing lost?  Well, so be it.  There is one masterpiece fewer 
in the world.  The world can ill spare it, but I, sir, I (and here 
I strike my hollow boson, so that it resounds) I am full of this 
sort of bauble; I am made of it; it comes to me, sir, as the desire 
to sneeze comes upon poor ordinary devils on cold days, when they 
should be getting out of bed and into their horrid cold tubs by the 
light of a seven o'clock candle, with the dismal seven o'clock 
frost-flowers all over the window.
</p><p>Show Stephen what you please; if you could show him how to give me 
money, you would oblige, sincerely yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>I have a scroll of SPRINGTIME somewhere, but I know that it is not 
in very good order, and do not feel myself up to very much grind 
over it.  I am damped about SPRINGTIME, that's the truth of it.  It 
might have been four or five quid!
</p><p>Sir, I shall shave my head, if this goes on.  All men take a 
pleasure to gird at me.  The laws of nature are in open war with 
me.  The wheel of a dog-cart took the toes off my new boots.  Gout 
has set in with extreme rigour, and cut me out of the cheap 
refreshment of beer.  I leant my back against an oak, I thought it 
was a trusty tree, but first it bent, and syne - it lost the Spirit 
of Springtime, and so did Professor Sidney Colvin, Trinity College, 
to me. - Ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>Along with this, I send you some P.P.P's; if you lose them, you 
need not seek to look upon my face again.  Do, for God's sake, 
answer me about them also; it is a horrid thing for a fond 
architect to find his monuments received in silence. - Yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, NOVEMBER 12, 1875.]
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - Since I got your letter I have been able to do a 
little more work, and I have been much better contented with 
myself; but I can't get away, that is absolutely prevented by the 
state of my purse and my debts, which, I may say, are red like 
crimson.  I don't know how I am to clear my hands of them, nor 
when, not before Christmas anyway.  Yesterday I was twenty-five; so 
please wish me many happy returns - directly.  This one was not 
UNhappy anyway.  I have got back a good deal into my old random, 
little-thought way of life, and do not care whether I read, write, 
speak, or walk, so long as I do something.  I have a great delight 
in this wheel-skating; I have made great advance in it of late, can 
do a good many amusing things (I mean amusing in MY sense - amusing 
to do).  You know, I lose all my forenoons at Court!  So it is, but 
the time passes; it is a great pleasure to sit and hear cases 
argued or advised.  This is quite autobiographical, but I feel as 
if it was some time since we met, and I can tell you, I am glad to 
meet you again.  In every way, you see, but that of work the world 
goes well with me.  My health is better than ever it was before; I 
get on without any jar, nay, as if there never had been a jar, with 
my parents.  If it weren't about that work, I'd be happy.  But the 
fact is, I don't think - the fact is, I'm going to trust in 
Providence about work.  If I could get one or two pieces I hate out 
of my way all would be well, I think; but these obstacles disgust 
me, and as I know I ought to do them first, I don't do anything.  I 
must finish this off, or I'll just lose another day.  I'll try to 
write again soon. - Ever your faithful friend,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. DE MATTOS
</p><p><br />
</p><p>EDINBURGH, JANUARY 1876.
</p><p>MY DEAR KATHARINE, - The prisoner reserved his defence.  He has 
been seedy, however; principally sick of the family evil, 
despondency; the sun is gone out utterly; and the breath of the 
people of this city lies about as a sort of damp, unwholesome fog, 
in which we go walking with bowed hearts.  If I understand what is 
a contrite spirit, I have one; it is to feel that you are a small 
jar, or rather, as I feel myself, a very large jar, of pottery work 
rather MAL REUSSI, and to make every allowance for the potter (I 
beg pardon; Potter with a capital P.) on his ill-success, and 
rather wish he would reduce you as soon as possible to potsherds.  
However, there are many things to do yet before we go
</p><p><br />
GROSSIR LA PATE UNIVERSELLE
FAITE DES FORMES QUE DIEU FOND.
</p><p><br />
For instance, I have never been in a revolution yet.  I pray God I 
may be in one at the end, if I am to make a mucker.  The best way 
to make a mucker is to have your back set against a wall and a few 
lead pellets whiffed into you in a moment, while yet you are all in 
a heat and a fury of combat, with drums sounding on all sides, and 
people crying, and a general smash like the infernal orchestration 
at the end of the HUGUENOTS. . . .
</p><p>Please pardon me for having been so long of writing, and show your 
pardon by writing soon to me; it will be a kindness, for I am 
sometimes very dull.  Edinburgh is much changed for the worse by 
the absence of Bob; and this damned weather weighs on me like a 
curse.  Yesterday, or the day before, there came so black a rain 
squall that I was frightened - what a child would call frightened, 
you know, for want of a better word - although in reality it has 
nothing to do with fright.  I lit the gas and sat cowering in my 
chair until it went away again. - Ever yours,

</p><p>O I am trying my hand at a novel just now; it may interest you to 
know, I am bound to say I do not think it will be a success.  
However, it's an amusement for the moment, and work, work is your 
only ally against the 'bearded people' that squat upon their hams 
in the dark places of life and embrace people horribly as they go 
by.  God save us from the bearded people! to think that the sun is 
still shining in some happy places!

</p><p>. . . OUR weather continues as it was, bitterly cold, and raining 
often.  There is not much pleasure in life certainly as it stands 
at present.  NOUS N'IRONS PLUS AU BOSS, HELAS!
</p><p>I meant to write some more last night, but my father was ill and it 
put it out of my way.  He is better this morning.
</p><p>If I had written last night, I should have written a lot.  But this 
morning I am so dreadfully tired and stupid that I can say nothing.  
I was down at Leith in the afternoon.  God bless me, what horrid 
women I saw; I never knew what a plain-looking race it was before.  
I was sick at heart with the looks of them.  And the children, 
filthy and ragged!  And the smells!  And the fat black mud!
</p><p>My soul was full of disgust ere I got back.  And yet the ships were 
beautiful to see, as they are always; and on the pier there was a 
clean cold wind that smelt a little of the sea, though it came down 
the Firth, and the sunset had a certain ECLAT and warmth.  Perhaps 
if I could get more work done, I should be in a better trim to 
enjoy filthy streets and people and cold grim weather; but I don't 
much feel as if it was what I would have chosen.  I am tempted 
every day of my life to go off on another walking tour.  I like 
that better than anything else that I know. - Ever your faithful 
friend,

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, FEBRUARY 1876.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - 1ST.  I have sent 'Fontainebleau' long ago, long 
ago.  And Leslie Stephen is worse than tepid about it - liked 'some 
parts' of it 'very well,' the son of Belial.  Moreover, he proposes 
to shorten it; and I, who want MONEY, and money soon, and not glory 
and the illustration of the English language, I feel as if my 
poverty were going to consent.
</p><p>2ND.  I'm as fit as a fiddle after my walk.  I am four inches 
bigger about the waist than last July!  There, that's your prophecy 
did that.  I am on 'Charles of Orleans' now, but I don't know where 
to send him.  Stephen obviously spews me out of his mouth, and I 
spew him out of mine, so help me!  A man who doesn't like my 
'Fontainebleau'!  His head must be turned.
</p><p>3RD.  If ever you do come across my 'Spring' (I beg your pardon for 
referring to it again, but I don't want you to forget) send it off 
at once.
</p><p>4TH.  I went to Ayr, Maybole, Girvan, Ballantrae, Stranraer, 
Glenluce, and Wigton.  I shall make an article of it some day soon, 
'A Winter's Walk in Carrick and Galloway.'  I had a good time. -

</p><p>[SWANSTON COTTAGE, LOTHIANBURN, JULY 1876.]
</p><p>HERE I am, here, and very well too.  I am glad you liked 'Walking 
Tours'; I like it, too; I think it's prose; and I own with 
contrition that I have not always written prose.  However, I am 
'endeavouring after new obedience' (Scot. Shorter Catechism).  You 
don't say aught of 'Forest Notes,' which is kind.  There is one, if 
you will, that was too sweet to be wholesome.
</p><p>I am at 'Charles d'Orleans.'  About fifteen CORNHILL pages have 
already coule'd from under my facile plume - no, I mean eleven, 
fifteen of MS. - and we are not much more than half-way through, 
'Charles' and I; but he's a pleasant companion.  My health is very 
well; I am in a fine exercisy state.  Baynes is gone to London; if 
you see him, inquire about my 'Burns.'  They have sent me 5 pounds, 
5s, for it, which has mollified me horrid.  5 pounds, 5s. is a good 
deal to pay for a read of it in MS.; I can't complain. - Yours,

</p><p>[SWANSTON COTTAGE, LOTHIANBURN, JULY 1876.]
</p><p>. . . I HAVE the strangest repugnance for writing; indeed, I have 
nearly got myself persuaded into the notion that letters don't 
arrive, in order to salve my conscience for never sending them off.  
I'm reading a great deal of fifteenth century:  TRIAL OF JOAN OF 
ARC, PASTON LETTERS, BASIN, etc., also BOSWELL daily by way of a 
Bible; I mean to read BOSWELL now until the day I die.  And now and 
again a bit of PILGRIM'S PROGRESS.  Is that all?  Yes, I think 
that's all.  I have a thing in proof for the CORNHILL called 
VIRGINIBUS PUERISQUE.  'Charles of Orleans' is again laid aside, 
but in a good state of furtherance this time.  A paper called 'A 
Defence of Idlers' (which is really a defence of R. L. S.) is in a 
good way.  So, you see, I am busy in a tumultuous, knotless sort of 
fashion; and as I say, I take lots of exercise, and I'm as brown a 
berry.
</p><p>This is the first letter I've written for - O I don't know how 
long.
</p><p>JULY 30TH. - This is, I suppose, three weeks after I began.  Do, 
please, forgive me.
</p><p>To the Highlands, first, to the Jenkins', then to Antwerp; thence, 
by canoe with Simpson, to Paris and Grez (on the Loing, and an old 
acquaintance of mine on the skirts of Fontainebleau) to complete 
our cruise next spring (if we're all alive and jolly) by Loing and 
Loire, Saone and Rhone to the Mediterranean.  It should make a 
jolly book of gossip, I imagine.
</p><p>God bless you.
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - VIRGINIBUS PUERISQUE is in August CORNHILL.  'Charles of 
Orleans' is finished, and sent to Stephen; 'Idlers' ditto, and sent 
to Grove; but I've no word of either.  So I've not been idle.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHAUNY, AISNE [SEPTEMBER 1876].
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Here I am, you see; and if you will take to a 
map, you will observe I am already more than two doors from 
Antwerp, whence I started.  I have fought it through under the 
worst weather I ever saw in France; I have been wet through nearly 
every day of travel since the second (inclusive); besides this, I 
have had to fight against pretty mouldy health; so that, on the 
whole, the essayist and reviewer has shown, I think, some pluck.  
Four days ago I was not a hundred miles from being miserably 
drowned, to the immense regret of a large circle of friends and the 
permanent impoverishment of British Essayism and Reviewery.  My 
boat culbutted me under a fallen tree in a very rapid current; and 
I was a good while before I got on to the outside of that fallen 
tree; rather a better while than I cared about.  When I got up, I 
lay some time on my belly, panting, and exuded fluid.  All my 
symptoms JUSQU' ICI are trifling.  But I've a damned sore throat. - 
Yours ever,

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH, MAY 1877.
</p><p>. . . A PERFECT chorus of repudiation is sounding in my ears; and 
although you say nothing, I know you must be repudiating me, all 
the same.  Write I cannot - there's no good mincing matters, a 
letter frightens me worse than the devil; and I am just as unfit 
for correspondence as if I had never learned the three R.'s.
</p><p>Let me give my news quickly before I relapse into my usual 
idleness.  I have a terror lest I should relapse before I get this 
finished.  Courage, R. L. S.!  On Leslie Stephen's advice, I gave 
up the idea of a book of essays.  He said he didn't imagine I was 
rich enough for such an amusement; and moreover, whatever was worth 
publication was worth republication.  So the best of those I had 
ready:  'An Apology for Idlers' is in proof for the CORNHILL.  I 
have 'Villon' to do for the same magazine, but God knows when I'll 
get it done, for drums, trumpets - I'm engaged upon - trumpets, 
drums - a novel!  'THE HAIR TRUNK; OR, THE IDEAL COMMONWEALTH.'  It 
is a most absurd story of a lot of young Cambridge fellows who are 
going to found a new society, with no ideas on the subject, and 
nothing but Bohemian tastes in the place of ideas; and who are - 
well, I can't explain about the trunk - it would take too long - 
but the trunk is the fun of it - everybody steals it; burglary, 
marine fight, life on desert island on west coast of Scotland, 
sloops, etc.  The first scene where they make their grand schemes 
and get drunk is supposed to be very funny, by Henley.  I really 
saw him laugh over it until he cried.
</p><p>Please write to me, although I deserve it so little, and show a 
Christian spirit. - Ever your faithful friend,

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, AUGUST 1877.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I'm to be whipped away to-morrow to Penzance, 
where at the post-office a letter will find me glad and grateful.  
I am well, but somewhat tired out with overwork.  I have only been 
home a fortnight this morning, and I have already written to the 
tune of forty-five CORNHILL pages and upwards.  The most of it was 
only very laborious re-casting and re-modelling, it is true; but it 
took it out of me famously, all the same.
</p><p>TEMPLE BAR appears to like my 'Villon,' so I may count on another 
market there in the future, I hope.  At least, I am going to put it 
to the proof at once, and send another story, 'The Sire de 
Maletroit's Mousetrap':  a true novel, in the old sense; all 
unities preserved moreover, if that's anything, and I believe with 
some little merits; not so CLEVER perhaps as the last, but sounder 
and more natural.
</p><p>My 'Villon' is out this month; I should so much like to know what 
you think of it.  Stephen has written to me apropos of 'Idlers,' 
that something more in that vein would be agreeable to his views.  
From Stephen I count that a devil of a lot.
</p><p>I am honestly so tired this morning that I hope you will take this 
for what it's worth and give me an answer in peace. - Ever yours,
</p><p>LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[PENZANCE, AUGUST 1877.]
</p><p>. . . YOU will do well to stick to your burn, that is a delightful 
life you sketch, and a very fountain of health.  I wish I could 
live like that but, alas! it is just as well I got my 'Idlers' 
written and done with, for I have quite lost all power of resting.  
I have a goad in my flesh continually, pushing me to work, work, 
work.  I have an essay pretty well through for Stephen; a story, 
'The Sire de Maletroit's Mousetrap,' with which I shall try TEMPLE 
BAR; another story, in the clouds, 'The Stepfather's Story,' most 
pathetic work of a high morality or immorality, according to point 
of view; and lastly, also in the clouds, or perhaps a little 
farther away, an essay on the 'Two St. Michael's Mounts,' 
historical and picturesque; perhaps if it didn't come too long, I 
might throw in the 'Bass Rock,' and call it 'Three Sea Fortalices,' 
or something of that kind.  You see how work keeps bubbling in my 
mind.  Then I shall do another fifteenth century paper this autumn 
- La Sale and PETIT JEHAN DE SAINTRE, which is a kind of fifteenth 
century SANDFORD AND MERTON, ending in horrid immoral cynicism, as 
if the author had got tired of being didactic, and just had a good 
wallow in the mire to wind up with and indemnify himself for so 
much restraint.
</p><p>Cornwall is not much to my taste, being as bleak as the bleakest 
parts of Scotland, and nothing like so pointed and characteristic.  
It has a flavour of its own, though, which I may try and catch, if 
I find the space, in the proposed article.  'Will o' the Mill' I 
sent, red hot, to Stephen in a fit of haste, and have not yet had 
an answer.  I am quite prepared for a refusal.  But I begin to have 
more hope in the story line, and that should improve my income 
anyway.  I am glad you liked 'Villon'; some of it was not as good 
as it ought to be, but on the whole it seems pretty vivid, and the 
features strongly marked.  Vividness and not style is now my line; 
style is all very well, but vividness is the real line of country; 
if a thing is meant to be read, it seems just as well to try and 
make it readable.  I am such a dull person I cannot keep off my own 
immortal works.  Indeed, they are scarcely ever out of my head.  
And yet I value them less and less every day.  But occupation is 
the great thing; so that a man should have his life in his own 
pocket, and never be thrown out of work by anything.  I am glad to 
hear you are better.  I must stop - going to Land's End. - Always 
your faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO A. PATCHETT MARTIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[1877.]
</p><p>DEAR SIR, - It would not be very easy for me to give you any idea 
of the pleasure I found in your present.  People who write for the 
magazines (probably from a guilty conscience) are apt to suppose 
their works practically unpublished.  It seems unlikely that any 
one would take the trouble to read a little paper buried among so 
many others; and reading it, read it with any attention or 
pleasure.  And so, I can assure you, your little book, coming from 
so far, gave me all the pleasure and encouragement in the world.
</p><p>I suppose you know and remember Charles Lamb's essay on distant 
correspondents?  Well, I was somewhat of his way of thinking about 
my mild productions.  I did not indeed imagine they were read, and 
(I suppose I may say) enjoyed right round upon the other side of 
the big Football we have the honour to inhabit.  And as your 
present was the first sign to the contrary, I feel I have been very 
ungrateful in not writing earlier to acknowledge the receipt.  I 
dare say, however, you hate writing letters as much as I can do 
myself (for if you like my article, I may presume other points of 
sympathy between us); and on this hypothesis you will be ready to 
forgive me the delay.
</p><p>I may mention with regard to the piece of verses called 'Such is 
Life,' that I am not the only one on this side of the Football 
aforesaid to think it a good and bright piece of work, and 
recognised a link of sympathy with the poets who 'play in 
hostelries at euchre.' - Believe me, dear sir, yours truly,
</p><p>R. L S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO A. PATCHETT MARTIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH [DECEMBER 1877].
</p><p>MY DEAR SIR, - I am afraid you must already have condemned me for a 
very idle fellow truly.  Here it is more than two months since I 
received your letter; I had no fewer than three journals to 
acknowledge; and never a sign upon my part.  If you have seen a 
CORNHILL paper of mine upon idling, you will be inclined to set it 
all down to that.  But you will not be doing me justice.  Indeed, I 
have had a summer so troubled that I have had little leisure and 
still less inclination to write letters.  I was keeping the devil 
at bay with all my disposable activities; and more than once I 
thought he had me by the throat.  The odd conditions of our 
acquaintance enable me to say more to you than I would to a person 
who lived at my elbow.  And besides, I am too much pleased and 
flattered at our correspondence not to go as far as I can to set 
myself right in your eyes.
</p><p>In this damnable confusion (I beg pardon) I have lost all my 
possessions, or near about, and quite lost all my wits.  I wish I 
could lay my hands on the numbers of the REVIEW, for I know I 
wished to say something on that head more particularly than I can 
from memory; but where they have escaped to, only time or chance 
can show.  However, I can tell you so far, that I was very much 
pleased with the article on Bret Harte; it seemed to me just, 
clear, and to the point.  I agreed pretty well with all you said 
about George Eliot:  a high, but, may we not add? - a rather dry 
lady.  Did you - I forget - did you have a kick at the stern works 
of that melancholy puppy and humbug Daniel Deronda himself? - the 
Prince of prigs; the literary abomination of desolation in the way 
of manhood; a type which is enough to make a man forswear the love 
of women, if that is how it must be gained. . . . Hats off all the 
same, you understand:  a woman of genius.
</p><p>Of your poems I have myself a kindness for 'Noll and Nell,' 
although I don't think you have made it as good as you ought:  
verse five is surely not QUITE MELODIOUS.  I confess I like the 
Sonnet in the last number of the REVIEW - the Sonnet to England.
</p><p>Please, if you have not, and I don't suppose you have, already read 
it, institute a search in all Melbourne for one of the rarest and 
certainly one of the best of books - CLARISSA HARLOWE.  For any man 
who takes an interest in the problems of the two sexes, that book 
is a perfect mine of documents.  And it is written, sir, with the 
pen of an angel.  Miss Howe and Lovelace, words cannot tell how 
good they are!  And the scene where Clarissa beards her family, 
with her fan going all the while; and some of the quarrel scenes 
between her and Lovelace; and the scene where Colonel Marden goes 
to Mr. Hall, with Lord M. trying to compose matters, and the 
Colonel with his eternal 'finest woman in the world,' and the 
inimitable affirmation of Mowbray - nothing, nothing could be 
better!  You will bless me when you read it for this 
recommendation; but, indeed, I can do nothing but recommend 
Clarissa.  I am like that Frenchman of the eighteenth century who 
discovered Habakkuk, and would give no one peace about that 
respectable Hebrew.  For my part, I never was able to get over his 
eminently respectable name; Isaiah is the boy, if you must have a 
prophet, no less.  About Clarissa, I meditate a choice work:  A 
DIALOGUE ON MAN, WOMAN, AND 'CLARISSA HARLOWE.'  It is to be so 
clever that no array of terms can give you any idea; and very 
likely that particular array in which I shall finally embody it, 
less than any other.
</p><p>Do you know, my dear sir, what I like best in your letter?  The 
egotism for which you thought necessary to apologise.  I am a rogue 
at egotism myself; and to be plain, I have rarely or never liked 
any man who was not.  The first step to discovering the beauties of 
God's universe is usually a (perhaps partial) apprehension of such 
of them as adorn our own characters.  When I see a man who does not 
think pretty well of himself, I always suspect him of being in the 
right.  And besides, if he does not like himself, whom he has seen, 
how is he ever to like one whom he never can see but in dim and 
artificial presentments?
</p><p>I cordially reciprocate your offer of a welcome; it shall be at 
least a warm one.  Are you not my first, my only, admirer - a dear 
tie?  Besides, you are a man of sense, and you treat me as one by 
writing to me as you do, and that gives me pleasure also.  Please 
continue to let me see your work.  I have one or two things coming 
out in the CORNHILL:  a story called 'The Sire de Maletroit's Door' 
in TEMPLE BAR; and a series of articles on Edinburgh in the 
PORTFOLIO; but I don't know if these last fly all the way to 
Melbourne. - Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am at the INLAND VOYAGE again:  have finished 
another section, and have only two more to execute.  But one at 
least of these will be very long - the longest in the book - being 
a great digression on French artistic tramps.  I only hope Paul may 
take the thing; I want coin so badly, and besides it would be 
something done - something put outside of me and off my conscience; 
and I should not feel such a muff as I do, if once I saw the thing 
in boards with a ticket on its back.  I think I shall frequent 
circulating libraries a good deal.  The Preface shall stand over, 
as you suggest, until the last, and then, sir, we shall see.  This 
to be read with a big voice.
</p><p>This is New Year's Day:  let me, my dear Colvin, wish you a very 
good year, free of all misunderstanding and bereavement, and full 
of good weather and good work.  You know best what you have done

</p><p>[PARIS, JANUARY OR FEBRUARY 1878.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Many thanks for your letter.  I was much 
interested by all the Edinburgh gossip.  Most likely I shall arrive 
in London next week.  I think you know all about the Crane sketch; 
but it should be a river, not a canal, you know, and the look 
should be 'cruel, lewd, and kindly,' all at once.  There is more 
sense in that Greek myth of Pan than in any other that I recollect 
except the luminous Hebrew one of the Fall:  one of the biggest 
things done.  If people would remember that all religions are no 
more than representations of life, they would find them, as they 
are, the best representations, licking Shakespeare.
</p><p>What an inconceivable cheese is Alfred de Musset!  His comedies 
are, to my view, the best work of France this century:  a large 
order.  Did you ever read them?  They are real, clear, living work. 
- Ever yours,

</p><p><br />
</p><p>PARIS, 44 BD. HAUSSMANN, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1878.
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - Do you know who is my favourite author just now?  
How are the mighty fallen!  Anthony Trollope.  I batten on him; he 
is so nearly wearying you, and yet he never does; or rather, he 
never does, until he gets near the end, when he begins to wean you 
from him, so that you're as pleased to be done with him as you 
thought you would be sorry.  I wonder if it's old age?  It is a 
little, I am sure.  A young person would get sickened by the dead 
level of meanness and cowardliness; you require to be a little 
spoiled and cynical before you can enjoy it.  I have just finished 
the WAY OF THE WORLD; there is only one person in it - no, there 
are three - who are nice:  the wild American woman, and two of the 
dissipated young men, Dolly and Lord Nidderdale.  All the heroes 
and heroines are just ghastly.  But what a triumph is Lady Carbury!  
That is real, sound, strong, genuine work:  the man who could do 
that, if he had had courage, might have written a fine book; he has 
preferred to write many readable ones.  I meant to write such a 
long, nice letter, but I cannot hold the pen.

tone of the critics than I suppose any one else.  And the effect it 
has produced in me is one of shame.  If they liked that so much, I 
ought to have given them something better, that's all.  And I shall

well laid out; I shall go near no town till I get to Alais.  
Remember, Poste Restante, Alais, Gard.  Greyfriars will be in 
October.  You did not say whether you liked September; you might 
tell me that at Alais.  The other No.'s of Edinburgh are:  
Parliament Close, Villa Quarters (which perhaps may not appear), 
Calton Hill, Winter and New Year, and to the Pentland Hills.  'Tis 
a kind of book nobody would ever care to read; but none of the 
young men could have done it better than I have, which is always a 
consolation.  I read INLAND VOYAGE the other day:  what rubbish 
these reviewers did talk!  It is not badly written, thin, mildly 
cheery, and strained.  SELON MOI.  I mean to visit Hamerton on my

</p><p>[MONASTIER, SEPTEMBER 1878.]
</p><p>DEAR HENLEY, - I hope to leave Monastier this day (Saturday) week; 
thenceforward Poste Restante, Alais, Gard, is my address.  'Travels 
with a Donkey in the French Highlands.'  I am no good to-day.  I 
cannot work, nor even write letters.  A colossal breakfast 
yesterday at Puy has, I think, done for me for ever; I certainly 
ate more than ever I ate before in my life - a big slice of melon, 
some ham and jelly, A FILET, a helping of gudgeons, the breast and 
leg of a partridge, some green peas, eight crayfish, some Mont d'Or 
cheese, a peach, and a handful of biscuits, macaroons, and things.  
It sounds Gargantuan; it cost three francs a head.  So that it was 
inexpensive to the pocket, although I fear it may prove extravagant 
to the fleshly tabernacle.  I can't think how I did it or why.  It 
is a new form of excess for me; but I think it pays less than any 
of them.

<p>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MONASTIER, AT MOREL'S [SEPTEMBER 1878].
</p><p>Lud knows about date, VIDE postmark.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Yours (with enclosures) of the 16th to hand.  
All work done.  I go to Le Puy to-morrow to dispatch baggage, get 
cash, stand lunch to engineer, who has been very jolly and useful 
to me, and hope by five o'clock on Saturday morning to be driving 
Modestine towards the Gevaudan.  Modestine is my anesse; a darling, 
mouse-colour, about the size of a Newfoundland dog (bigger, between 
you and me), the colour of a mouse, costing 65 francs and a glass 
of brandy.  Glad you sent on all the coin; was half afraid I might 
come to a stick in the mountains, donkey and all, which would have 
been the devil.  Have finished ARABIAN NIGHTS and Edinburgh book, 
and am a free man.  Next address, Poste Restante, Alais, Gard.  
Give my servilities to the family.  Health bad; spirits, I think, 
looking up. - Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>OCTOBER 1878.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I have seen Hamerton; he was very kind, all his 
family seemed pleased to see an INLAND VOYAGE, and the book seemed 
to be quite a household word with them.  P. G. himself promised to 
help me in my bargains with publishers, which, said he, and I doubt 
not very truthfully, he could manage to much greater advantage than 
I.  He is also to read an INLAND VOYAGE over again, and send me his 
cuts and cuffs in private, after having liberally administered his 
kisses CORAM PUBLICO.  I liked him very much.  Of all the pleasant 
parts of my profession, I think the spirit of other men of letters 
makes the pleasantest.
</p><p>Do you know, your sunset was very good?  The 'attack' (to speak 
learnedly) was so plucky and odd.  I have thought of it repeatedly 
since.  I have just made a delightful dinner by myself in the Cafe 
Felix, where I am an old established beggar, and am just smoking a 
cigar over my coffee.  I came last night from Autun, and I am 
muddled about my plans.  The world is such a dance! - Ever your 
affectionate son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, AUTUMN 1878.]
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Here I am living like a fighting-cock, and have 
not spoken to a real person for about sixty hours.  Those who wait 
on me are not real.  The man I know to be a myth, because I have 
seen him acting so often in the Palais Royal.  He plays the Duke in 
TRICOCHE ET CACOLET; I knew his nose at once.  The part he plays 
here is very dull for him, but conscientious.  As for the bedmaker, 
she's a dream, a kind of cheerful, innocent nightmare; I never saw 
so poor an imitation of humanity.  I cannot work - CANNOT.  Even 
the GUITAR is still undone; I can only write ditch-water.  'Tis 
ghastly; but I am quite cheerful, and that is more important.  Do 
you think you could prepare the printers for a possible breakdown 
this week?  I shall try all I know on Monday; but if I can get 
nothing better than I got this morning, I prefer to drop a week.  
Telegraph to me if you think it necessary.  I shall not leave till 
Wednesday at soonest.  Shall write again.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH, APRIL 16, 1879].  POOL OF SILOAM, By EL 
DORADO, DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS, ARCADIA
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Herewith of the dibbs - a homely fiver.  How, and 
why, do you continue to exist?  I do so ill, but for a variety of 
reasons.  First, I wait an angel to come down and trouble the 
waters; second, more angels; third - well, more angels.  The waters 
are sluggish; the angels - well, the angels won't come, that's 
about all.  But I sit waiting and waiting, and people bring me 
meals, which help to pass time (I'm sure it's very kind of them), 
and sometimes I whistle to myself; and as there's a very pretty 
echo at my pool of Siloam, the thing's agreeable to hear.  The sun 
continues to rise every day, to my growing wonder.  'The moon by 
night thee shall not smite.'  And the stars are all doing as well 
as can be expected.  The air of Arcady is very brisk and pure, and 
we command many enchanting prospects in space and time.  I do not 
yet know much about my situation; for, to tell the truth, I only 
came here by the run since I began to write this letter; I had to 
go back to date it; and I am grateful to you for having been the 
occasion of this little outing.  What good travellers we are, if we 
had only faith; no man need stay in Edinburgh but by unbelief; my 
religious organ has been ailing for a while past, and I have lain a 
great deal in Edinburgh, a sheer hulk in consequence.  But I got 
out my wings, and have taken a change of air.
</p><p>I read your book with great interest, and ought long ago to have 
told you so.  An ordinary man would say that he had been waiting 
till he could pay his debts. . . . The book is good reading.  Your 
personal notes of those you saw struck me as perhaps most sharp and 
'best held.'  See as many people as you can, and make a book of 
them before you die.  That will be a living book, upon my word.  
You have the touch required.  I ask you to put hands to it in 
private already.  Think of what Carlyle's caricature of old 
Coleridge is to us who never saw S. T. C.  With that and Kubla 
Khan, we have the man in the fact.  Carlyle's picture, of course, 
is not of the author of KUBLA, but of the author of that surprising 
FRIEND which has knocked the breath out of two generations of 
hopeful youth.  Your portraits would be milder, sweeter, more true 
perhaps, and perhaps not so truth-TELLING - if you will take my 
meaning.
</p><p>I have to thank you for an introduction to that beautiful - no, 
that's not the word - that jolly, with an Arcadian jollity - thing 
of Vogelweide's.  Also for your preface.  Some day I want to read a 
whole book in the same picked dialect as that preface.  I think it 
must be one E. W. Gosse who must write it.  He has got himself into 
a fix with me by writing the preface; I look for a great deal, and 
will not be easily pleased.
</p><p>I never thought of it, but my new book, which should soon be out, 
contains a visit to a murder scene, but not done as we should like 
to see them, for, of course, I was running another hare.
</p><p>If you do not answer this in four pages, I shall stop the enclosed 
fiver at the bank, a step which will lead to your incarceration for 
life.  As my visits to Arcady are somewhat uncertain, you had 
better address 17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, as usual.  I shall walk 
over for the note if I am not yet home. - Believe me, very really 
yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I charge extra for a flourish when it is successful; this isn't, so 
you have it gratis.  Is there any news in Babylon the Great?  My 
fellow-creatures are electing school boards here in the midst of 
the ages.  It is very composed of them.  I can't think why they do 
it.  Nor why I have written a real letter.  If you write a real 
letter back, damme, I'll try to CORRESPOND with you.  A thing 
unknown in this age.  It is a consequence of the decay of faith; we 
cannot believe that the fellow will be at the pains to read us.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH [APRIL 1879].
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Heavens! have I done the like?  'Clarify and 
strain,' indeed?  'Make it like Marvell,' no less.  I'll tell you 
what - you may go to the devil; that's what I think.  'Be eloquent' 
is another of your pregnant suggestions.  I cannot sufficiently 
thank you for that one.  Portrait of a person about to be eloquent 
at the request of a literary friend.  You seem to forget sir, that 
rhyme is rhyme, sir, and - go to the devil.
</p><p>I'll try to improve it, but I shan't be able to - O go to the 
devil.
</p><p>Seriously, you're a cool hand.  And then you have the brass to ask 
me WHY 'my steps went one by one'?   Why?  Powers of man! to rhyme 
with sun, to be sure.  Why else could it be?  And you yourself have 
been a poet!  G-r-r-r-r-r!  I'll never be a poet any more.  Men are 
so d-d ungrateful and captious, I declare I could weep.
</p><p><br />
O Henley, in my hours of ease
You may say anything you please,
But when I join the Muse's revel,
Begad, I wish you at the devil!
In vain my verse I plane and bevel,
Like Banville's rhyming devotees;
In vain by many an artful swivel
Lug in my meaning by degrees;
I'm sure to hear my Henley cavil;
And grovelling prostrate on my knees,
Devote his body to the seas,
His correspondence to the devil!
</p><p><br />
Impromptu poem.
</p><p>I'm going to Shandon Hydropathic CUM PARENTIBUS.  Write here.  I 
heard from Lang.  Ferrier prayeth to be remembered; he means to 
write, likes his Tourgenieff greatly.  Also likes my 'What was on 
the Slate,' which, under a new title, yet unfound, and with a new 
and, on the whole, kindly DENOUEMENT, is going to shoot up and 
become a star. . . .
</p><p>I see I must write some more to you about my Monastery.  I am a 
weak brother in verse.  You ask me to re-write things that I have 
already managed just to write with the skin of my teeth.  If I 
don't re-write them, it's because I don't see how to write them 
better, not because I don't think they should be.  But, curiously 
enough, you condemn two of my favourite passages, one of which is 
J. W. Ferrier's favourite of the whole.  Here I shall think it's 
you who are wrong.  You see, I did not try to make good verse, but 
to say what I wanted as well as verse would let me.  I don't like 
the rhyme 'ear' and 'hear.'  But the couplet, 'My undissuaded heart 
I hear Whisper courage in my ear,' is exactly what I want for the 
thought, and to me seems very energetic as speech, if not as verse.  
Would 'daring' be better than 'courage'?  JE ME LE DEMANDE.  No, it 
would be ambiguous, as though I had used it licentiously for 
'daringly,' and that would cloak the sense.
</p><p>In short, your suggestions have broken the heart of the scald.  He 
doesn't agree with them all; and those he does agree with, the 
spirit indeed is willing, but the d-d flesh cannot, cannot, cannot, 
see its way to profit by.  I think I'll lay it by for nine years, 
like Horace.  I think the well of Castaly's run out.  No more the 
Muses round my pillow haunt.  I am fallen once more to the mere 
proser.  God bless you.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SWANSTON, LOTHIANBURN, EDINBURGH, JULY 24, 1879.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I have greatly enjoyed your articles which seems 
to me handsome in tone, and written like a fine old English 
gentleman.  But is there not a hitch in the sentence at foot of 
page 153?  I get lost in it.
</p><p>Chapters VIII. and IX. of Meredith's story are very good, I think.  
But who wrote the review of my book? whoever he was, he cannot 
write; he is humane, but a duffer; I could weep when I think of 
him; for surely to be virtuous and incompetent is a hard lot.  I 
should prefer to be a bold pirate, the gay sailor-boy of 
immorality, and a publisher at once.  My mind is extinct; my 
appetite is expiring; I have fallen altogether into a hollow-eyed, 
yawning way of life, like the parties in Burne Jones's pictures. . 
. . Talking of Burns.  (Is this not sad, Weg?  I use the term of 
reproach not because I am angry with you this time, but because I 
am angry with myself and desire to give pain.)  Talking, I say, of 
Robert Burns, the inspired poet is a very gay subject for study.  I 
made a kind of chronological table of his various loves and lusts, 
and have been comparatively speechless ever since.  I am sorry to 
say it, but there was something in him of the vulgar, bagmanlike, 
professional seducer. - Oblige me by taking down and reading, for 
the hundredth time I hope, his 'Twa Dogs' and his 'Address to the 
Unco Guid.'  I am only a Scotchman, after all, you see; and when I 
have beaten Burns, I am driven at once, by my parental feelings, to 
console him with a sugar-plum.  But hang me if I know anything I 
like so well as the 'Twa Dogs.'  Even a common Englishman may have 
a glimpse, as it were from Pisgah, of its extraordinary merits.
</p><p>'ENGLISH, THE:  - a dull people, incapable of comprehending the 
Scottish tongue.  Their history is so intimately connected with 
that of Scotland, that we must refer our readers to that heading.  
Their literature is principally the work of venal Scots.' - 
Stevenson's HANDY CYCLOPAEDIA.  Glescow:  Blaikie &amp; Bannock.
</p><p>Remember me in suitable fashion to Mrs. Gosse, the offspring, and 
the cat. - And believe me ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH [JULY 28, 1879].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am just in the middle of your Rembrandt.  The 
taste for Bummkopf and his works is agreeably dissembled so far as 
I have gone; and the reins have never for an instant been thrown 
upon the neck of that wooden Pegasus; he only perks up a learned 
snout from a footnote in the cellarage of a paragraph; just, in 
short, where he ought to be, to inspire confidence in a wicked and 
adulterous generation.  But, mind you, Bummkopf is not human; he is 
Dagon the fish god, and down he will come, sprawling on his belly 
or his behind, with his hands broken from his helpless carcase, and 
his head rolling off into a corner.  Up will rise on the other 
side, sane, pleasurable, human knowledge:  a thing of beauty and a 
joy, etc.
</p><p>I'm three parts through Burns; long, dry, unsympathetic, but sound 
and, I think, in its dry way, interesting.  Next I shall finish the 
story, and then perhaps Thoreau.  Meredith has been staying with 
Morley, who is about, it is believed, to write to me on a literary 
scheme.  Is it Keats, hope you?  My heart leaps at the thought. - 
Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>17 HERIOT ROW, EDINBURGH [JULY 29, 1879].
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Yours was delicious; you are a young person of 
wit; one of the last of them; wit being quite out of date, and 
humour confined to the Scotch Church and the SPECTATOR in 
unconscious survival.  You will probably be glad to hear that I am 
up again in the world; I have breathed again, and had a frolic on 
the strength of it.  The frolic was yesterday, Sawbath; the scene, 
the Royal Hotel, Bathgate; I went there with a humorous friend to 
lunch.  The maid soon showed herself a lass of character.  She was 
looking out of window.  On being asked what she was after, 'I'm 
lookin' for my lad,' says she.  'Is that him?'  'Weel, I've been 
lookin' for him a' my life, and I've never seen him yet,' was the 
response.  I wrote her some verses in the vernacular; she read 
them.  'They're no bad for a beginner,' said she.  The landlord's 
daughter, Miss Stewart, was present in oil colour; so I wrote her a 
declaration in verse, and sent it by the handmaid.  She (Miss S.) 
was present on the stair to witness our departure, in a warm, 
suffused condition.  Damn it, Gosse, you needn't suppose that 
you're the only poet in the world.
</p><p>Your statement about your initials, it will be seen, I pass over in 
contempt and silence.  When once I have made up my mind, let me 
tell you, sir, there lives no pock-pudding who can change it.  Your 
anger I defy.  Your unmanly reference to a well-known statesman I 
puff from me, sir, like so much vapour.  Weg is your name; Weg.  W 
E G.
</p><p>My enthusiasm has kind of dropped from me.  I envy you your wife, 
your home, your child - I was going to say your cat.  There would 
be cats in my home too if I could but get it.  I may seem to you 
'the impersonation of life,' but my life is the impersonation of 
waiting, and that's a poor creature.  God help us all, and the deil 
be kind to the hindmost!  Upon my word, we are a brave, cheery 
crew, we human beings, and my admiration increases daily - 
primarily for myself, but by a roundabout process for the whole 
crowd; for I dare say they have all their poor little secrets and 
anxieties.  And here am I, for instance, writing to you as if you 
were in the seventh heaven, and yet I know you are in a sad anxiety 
yourself.  I hope earnestly it will soon be over, and a fine pink 
Gosse sprawling in a tub, and a mother in the best of health and 
spirits, glad and tired, and with another interest in life.  Man, 
you are out of the trouble when this is through.  A first child is 
a rival, but a second is only a rival to the first; and the husband 
stands his ground and may keep married all his life - a 
consummation heartily to be desired.  Good-bye, Gosse.  Write me a 
witty letter with good news of the mistress.
</p><p>R. L. S.
