Letter:  TO THE EDITOR OF THE 'NEW YORK TRIBUNE'
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TERMINUS HOTEL, MARSEILLES, OCTOBER 16, 1882.
</p><p>SIR, - It has come to my ears that you have lent the authority of 
your columns to an error.
</p><p>More than half in pleasantry - and I now think the pleasantry ill-
judged - I complained in a note to my NEW ARABIAN NIGHTS that some 
one, who shall remain nameless for me, had borrowed the idea of a 
story from one of mine.  As if I had not borrowed the ideas of the 
half of my own!  As if any one who had written a story ill had a 
right to complain of any other who should have written it better!  
I am indeed thoroughly ashamed of the note, and of the principle 
which it implies.
</p><p>But it is no mere abstract penitence which leads me to beg a corner 
of your paper - it is the desire to defend the honour of a man of 
letters equally known in America and England, of a man who could 
afford to lend to me and yet be none the poorer; and who, if he 
would so far condescend, has my free permission to borrow from me 
all that he can find worth borrowing.
</p><p>Indeed, sir, I am doubly surprised at your correspondent's error.  
That James Payn should have borrowed from me is already a strange 
conception.  The author of LOST SIR MASSINGBERD and BY PROXY may be 
trusted to invent his own stories.  The author of A GRAPE FROM A 
THORN knows enough, in his own right, of the humorous and pathetic 
sides of human nature.
</p><p>But what is far more monstrous - what argues total ignorance of the 
man in question - is the idea that James Payn could ever have 
transgressed the limits of professional propriety.  I may tell his 
thousands of readers on your side of the Atlantic that there 
breathes no man of letters more inspired by kindness and generosity 
to his brethren of the profession, and, to put an end to any 
possibility of error, I may be allowed to add that I often have 
recourse, and that I had recourse once more but a few weeks ago, to 
the valuable practical help which he makes it his pleasure to 
extend to younger men.
</p><p>I send a duplicate of this letter to a London weekly; for the 
mistake, first set forth in your columns, has already reached 
England, and my wanderings have made me perhaps last of the persons 
interested to hear a word of it. - I am, etc.,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TERMINUS HOTEL, MARSEILLE, SATURDAY (OCTOBER 1882).
</p><p>MY DEAR BOB, - We have found a house! - at Saint Marcel, Banlieue 
de Marseille.  In a lovely valley between hills part wooded, part 
white cliffs; a house of a dining-room, of a fine salon - one side 
lined with a long divan - three good bedrooms (two of them with 
dressing-rooms), three small rooms (chambers of BONNE and sich), a 
large kitchen, a lumber room, many cupboards, a back court, a 
large, large olive yard, cultivated by a resident PAYSAN, a well, a 
berceau, a good deal of rockery, a little pine shrubbery, a railway 
station in front, two lines of omnibus to Marseille.
</p><p>48 pounds per annum.
</p><p>It is called Campagne Defli! query Campagne Debug?  The Campagne 
Demosquito goes on here nightly, and is very deadly.  Ere we can 
get installed, we shall be beggared to the door, I see.
</p><p>I vote for separations; F.'s arrival here, after our separation, 
was better fun to me than being married was by far.  A separation 
completed is a most valuable property; worth piles. - Ever your 
affectionate cousin,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TERMINUS HOTEL, MARSEILLE, LE 17TH OCTOBER 1882.
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - . .  We grow, every time we see it, more 
delighted with our house.  It is five miles out of Marseilles, in a 
lovely spot, among lovely wooded and cliffy hills - most 
mountainous in line - far lovelier, to my eyes, than any Alps.  To-
day we have been out inventorying; and though a mistral blew, it 
was delightful in an open cab, and our house with the windows open 
was heavenly, soft, dry, sunny, southern.  I fear there are fleas - 
it is called Campagne Defli - and I look forward to tons of 
insecticide being employed.
</p><p>I have had to write a letter to the NEW YORK TRIBUNE and the 
ATHENAEUM.  Payn was accused of stealing my stories!  I think I 
have put things handsomely for him.
</p><p>Just got a servant!&#160;!&#160;! - Ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>Our servant is a Muckle Hash of a Weedy!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CAMPAGNE DEFLI, ST. MARCEL, BANLIEUE DE MARSEILLE, NOVEMBER 13, 
1882.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - Your delightful letters duly arrived this 
morning.  They were the only good feature of the day, which was not 
a success.  Fanny was in bed - she begged I would not split upon 
her, she felt so guilty; but as I believe she is better this 
evening, and has a good chance to be right again in a day or two, I 
will disregard her orders.  I do not go back, but do not go forward 
- or not much.  It is, in one way, miserable - for I can do no 
work; a very little wood-cutting, the newspapers, and a note about 
every two days to write, completely exhausts my surplus energy; 
even Patience I have to cultivate with parsimony.  I see, if I 
could only get to work, that we could live here with comfort, 
almost with luxury.  Even as it is, we should be able to get 
through a considerable time of idleness.  I like the place 
immensely, though I have seen so little of it - I have only been 
once outside the gate since I was here!  It puts me in mind of a 
summer at Prestonpans and a sickly child you once told me of.
</p><p>Thirty-two years now finished!  My twenty-ninth was in San 
Francisco, I remember - rather a bleak birthday.  The twenty-eighth 
was not much better; but the rest have been usually pleasant days 
in pleasant circumstances.
</p><p>Love to you and to my father and to Cummy.
</p><p>From me and Fanny and Wogg.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>GRAND HOTEL, NICE, 12TH JANUARY '83.
</p><p>DEAR CHARLES, - Thanks for your good letter.  It is true, man, 
God's truth, what ye say about the body Stevison.  The deil himsel, 
it's my belief, couldnae get the soul harled oot o' the creature's 
wame, or he had seen the hinder end o' they proofs.  Ye crack o' 
Maecenas, he's naebody by you!  He gied the lad Horace a rax forrit 
by all accounts; but he never gied him proofs like yon.  Horace may 
hae been a better hand at the clink than Stevison - mind, I'm no 
sayin' 't - but onyway he was never sae weel prentit.  Damned, but 
it's bonny!  Hoo mony pages will there be, think ye?  Stevison maun 
hae sent ye the feck o' twenty sangs - fifteen I'se warrant.  Weel, 
that'll can make thretty pages, gin ye were to prent on ae side 
only, whilk wad be perhaps what a man o' your GREAT idees would be 
ettlin' at, man Johnson.  Then there wad be the Pre-face, an' prose 
ye ken prents oot langer than po'try at the hinder end, for ye hae 
to say things in't.  An' then there'll be a title-page and a 
dedication and an index wi' the first lines like, and the deil an' 
a'.  Man, it'll be grand.  Nae copies to be given to the Liberys.
</p><p>I am alane myself, in Nice, they ca't, but damned, I think they 
micht as well ca't Nesty.  The Pile-on, 's they ca't, 's aboot as 
big as the river Tay at Perth; and it's rainin' maist like 
Greenock.  Dod, I've seen 's had mair o' what they ca' the I-talian 
at Muttonhole.  I-talian!  I haenae seen the sun for eicht and 
forty hours.  Thomson's better, I believe.  But the body's fair 
attenyated.  He's doon to seeven stane eleeven, an' he sooks awa' 
at cod liver ile, till it's a fair disgrace.  Ye see he tak's it on 
a drap brandy; and it's my belief, it's just an excuse for a dram.  
He an' Stevison gang aboot their lane, maistly; they're company to 
either, like, an' whiles they'll speak o'Johnson.  But HE'S far 
awa', losh me!  Stevison's last book's in a third edeetion; an' 
it's bein' translated (like the psaulms o' David, nae less) into 
French; and an eediot they ca' Asher - a kind o' rival of Tauchnitz 
- is bringin' him oot in a paper book for the Frenchies and the 
German folk in twa volumes.  Sae he's in luck, ye see. - Yours,
</p><p>THOMSON.

<p>Letter:  TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[NICE FEBRUARY 1883.]
</p><p>MY DEAR CUMMY, - You must think, and quite justly, that I am one of 
the meanest rogues in creation.  But though I do not write (which 
is a thing I hate), it by no means follows that people are out of 
my mind.  It is natural that I should always think more or less 
about you, and still more natural that I should think of you when I 
went back to Nice.  But the real reason why you have been more in 
my mind than usual is because of some little verses that I have 
been writing, and that I mean to make a book of; and the real 
reason of this letter (although I ought to have written to you 
anyway) is that I have just seen that the book in question must be 
dedicated to
</p><p>ALISON CUNNINGHAM,
</p><p>the only person who will really understand it.  I don't know when 
it may be ready, for it has to be illustrated, but I hope in the 
meantime you may like the idea of what is to be; and when the time 
comes, I shall try to make the dedication as pretty as I can make 
it.  Of course, this is only a flourish, like taking off one's hat; 
but still, a person who has taken the trouble to write things does 
not dedicate them to any one without meaning it; and you must just 
try to take this dedication in place of a great many things that I 
might have said, and that I ought to have done, to prove that I am 
not altogether unconscious of the great debt of gratitude I owe 
you.  This little book, which is all about my childhood, should 
indeed go to no other person but you, who did so much to make that 
childhood happy.
</p><p>Do you know, we came very near sending for you this winter.  If we 
had not had news that you were ill too, I almost believe we should 
have done so, we were so much in trouble.
</p><p>I am now very well; but my wife has had a very, very bad spell, 
through overwork and anxiety, when I was LOST!  I suppose you heard 
of that.  She sends you her love, and hopes you will write to her, 
though she no more than I deserves it.  She would add a word 
herself, but she is too played out. - I am, ever your old boy,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[NICE, MARCH 1883.]
</p><p>MY DEAR LAD, - This is to announce to you the MS. of Nursery 
Verses, now numbering XLVIII. pieces or 599 verses, which, of 
course, one might augment AD INFINITUM.
</p><p>But here is my notion to make all clear.
</p><p>I do not want a big ugly quarto; my soul sickens at the look of a 
quarto.  I want a refined octavo, not large - not LARGER than the 
DONKEY BOOK, at any price.
</p><p>I think the full page might hold four verses of four lines, that is 
to say, counting their blanks at two, of twenty-two lines in 
height.  The first page of each number would only hold two verses 
or ten lines, the title being low down.  At this rate, we should 
have seventy-eight or eighty pages of letterpress.
</p><p>The designs should not be in the text, but facing the poem; so that 
if the artist liked, he might give two pages of design to every 
poem that turned the leaf, I.E. longer than eight lines, I.E. to 
twenty-eight out of the forty-six.  I should say he would not use 
this privilege (?) above five times, and some he might scorn to 
illustrate at all, so we may say fifty drawings.  I shall come to 
the drawings next.
</p><p>But now you see my book of the thickness, since the drawings count 
two pages, of 180 pages; and since the paper will perhaps be 
thicker, of near two hundred by bulk.  It is bound in a quiet green 
with the words in thin gilt.  Its shape is a slender, tall octavo.  
And it sells for the publisher's fancy, and it will be a darling to 
look at; in short, it would be like one of the original Heine books 
in type and spacing.
</p><p>Now for the pictures.  I take another sheet and begin to jot notes 
for them when my imagination serves:  I will run through the book, 
writing when I have an idea.  There, I have jotted enough to give 
the artist a notion.  Of course, I don't do more than contribute 
ideas, but I will be happy to help in any and every way.  I may as 
well add another idea; when the artist finds nothing much to 
illustrate, a good drawing of any OBJECT mentioned in the text, 
were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick, is a most delightful 
thing to a young child.  I remember this keenly.
</p><p>Of course, if the artist insists on a larger form, I must I 
suppose, bow my head.  But my idea I am convinced is the best, and 
would make the book truly, not fashionably pretty.
</p><p>I forgot to mention that I shall have a dedication; I am going to 
dedicate 'em to Cummy; it will please her, and lighten a little my 
burthen of ingratitude.  A low affair is the Muse business.
</p><p>I will add no more to this lest you should want to communicate with 
the artist; try another sheet.  I wonder how many I'll keep 
wandering to.
</p><p>O I forgot.  As for the title, I think 'Nursery Verses' the best.  
Poetry is not the strong point of the text, and I shrink from any 
title that might seem to claim that quality; otherwise we might 
have 'Nursery Muses' or 'New Songs of Innocence' (but that were a 
blasphemy), or 'Rimes of Innocence':  the last not bad, or - an 
idea - 'The Jews' Harp,' or - now I have it - 'The Penny Whistle.'
</p><p><br />
THE PENNY WHISTLE:
NURSERY VERSES
BY
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
ILLUSTRATED BY - - -
</p><p><br />
And here we have an excellent frontispiece, of a party playing on a 
P. W. to a little ring of dancing children.
</p><p><br />
THE PENNY WHISTLE
is the name for me.
</p><p><br />
Fool! this is all wrong, here is the true name:-
</p><p><br />
PENNY WHISTLES
FOR SMALL WHISTLERS.
</p><p><br />
The second title is queried, it is perhaps better, as simply PENNY 
WHISTLES.
</p><p><br />
Nor you, O Penny Whistler, grudge
That I your instrument debase:
By worse performers still we judge,
And give that fife a second place!
</p><p>Crossed penny whistles on the cover, or else a sheaf of 'em.
</p><p><br />
SUGGESTIONS.
</p><p><br />
IV. The procession - the child running behind it.  The procession 
tailing off through the gates of a cloudy city.
</p><p>IX. FOREIGN LANDS. - This will, I think, want two plates - the 
child climbing, his first glimpse over the garden wall, with what 
he sees - the tree shooting higher and higher like the beanstalk, 
and the view widening.  The river slipping in.  The road arriving 
in Fairyland.
</p><p>X. WINDY NIGHTS. - The child in bed listening - the horseman 
galloping.
</p><p>XII. The child helplessly watching his ship - then he gets smaller, 
and the doll joyfully comes alive - the pair landing on the island 
- the ship's deck with the doll steering and the child firing the

</p><p>HOTEL DES ILES D'OR, HYERES, VAR, MARCH 2, [1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - It must be at least a fortnight since we have had 
a scratch of a pen from you; and if it had not been for Cummy's 
letter, I should have feared you were worse again:  as it is, I 
hope we shall hear from you to-day or to-morrow at latest.
</p><p>HEALTH.
</p><p>Our news is good:  Fanny never got so bad as we feared, and we hope 
now that this attack may pass off in threatenings.  I am greatly 
better, have gained flesh, strength, spirits; eat well, walk a good 
deal, and do some work without fatigue.  I am off the sick list.
</p><p>LODGING.
</p><p>We have found a house up the hill, close to the town, an excellent 
place though very, very little.  If I can get the landlord to agree 
to let us take it by the month just now, and let our month's rent 
count for the year in case we take it on, you may expect to hear we 
are again installed, and to receive a letter dated thus:-
</p><p><br />
La Solitude,
Hyeres-les-Palmiers,
Var.
</p><p><br />
If the man won't agree to that, of course I must just give it up, 
as the house would be dear enough anyway at 2000 f.  However, I 
hope we may get it, as it is healthy, cheerful, and close to shops, 
and society, and civilisation.  The garden, which is above, is 
lovely, and will be cool in summer.  There are two rooms below with 
a kitchen, and four rooms above, all told. - Ever your affectionate 
son,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL DES ILES D'OR, BUT MY ADDRESS WILL BE CHALET LA SOLITUDE, 
HYERES-LE-PALMIERS, VAR, FRANCE, MARCH 17, 1883.
</p><p>DEAR SIR, - Your undated favour from Eastbourne came to hand in 
course of post, and I now hasten to acknowledge its receipt.  We 
must ask you in future, for the convenience of our business 
arrangements, to struggle with and tread below your feet this most 
unsatisfactory and uncommercial habit.  Our Mr. Cassandra is 
better; our Mr. Wogg expresses himself dissatisfied with our new 
place of business; when left alone in the front shop, he bawled 
like a parrot; it is supposed the offices are haunted.
</p><p>To turn to the matter of your letter, your remarks on GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS are very good.  We have both re-read it this winter, 
and I, in a manner, twice.  The object being a play; the play, in 
its rough outline, I now see:  and it is extraordinary how much of 
Dickens had to be discarded as unhuman, impossible, and 
ineffective:  all that really remains is the loan of a file (but 
from a grown-up young man who knows what he was doing, and to a 
convict who, although he does not know it is his father - the 
father knows it is his son), and the fact of the convict-father's 
return and disclosure of himself to the son whom he has made rich.  
Everything else has been thrown aside; and the position has had to 
be explained by a prologue which is pretty strong.  I have great 
hopes of this piece, which is very amiable and, in places, very 
strong indeed:  but it was curious how Dickens had to be rolled 
away; he had made his story turn on such improbabilities, such 
fantastic trifles, not on a good human basis, such as I recognised.  
You are right about the casts, they were a capital idea; a good 
description of them at first, and then afterwards, say second, for 
the lawyer to have illustrated points out of the history of the 
originals, dusting the particular bust - that was all the 
development the thing would bear.  Dickens killed them.  The only 
really well EXECUTED scenes are the riverside ones; the escape in 
particular is excellent; and I may add, the capture of the two 
convicts at the beginning.  Miss Havisham is, probably, the worst 
thing in human fiction.  But Wemmick I like; and I like Trabb's 
boy; and Mr. Wopsle as Hamlet is splendid.
</p><p>The weather here is greatly improved, and I hope in three days to 
be in the chalet.  That is, if I get some money to float me there.
</p><p>I hope you are all right again, and will keep better.  The month of 
March is past its mid career; it must soon begin to turn toward the 
lamb; here it has already begun to do so; and I hope milder weather 
will pick you up.  Wogg has eaten a forpet of rice and milk, his 
beard is streaming, his eyes wild.  I am besieged by demands of 
work from America.
</p><p>The 50 pounds has just arrived; many thanks; I am now at ease. - 
Ever your affectionate son, PRO Cassandra, Wogg and Co.,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, [APRIL 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - I am one of the lowest of the - but that's 
understood.  I received the copy, excellently written, with I think 
only one slip from first to last.  I have struck out two, and added 
five or six; so they now number forty-five; when they are fifty, 
they shall out on the world.  I have not written a letter for a 
cruel time; I have been, and am, so busy, drafting a long story 
(for me, I mean), about a hundred CORNHILL pages, or say about as 
long as the Donkey book:  PRINCE OTTO it is called, and is, at the 
present hour, a sore burthen but a hopeful.  If I had him all 
drafted, I should whistle and sing.  But no:  then I'll have to 
rewrite him; and then there will be the publishers, alas!  But some 
time or other, I shall whistle and sing, I make no doubt.
</p><p>I am going to make a fortune, it has not yet begun, for I am not 
yet clear of debt; but as soon as I can, I begin upon the fortune.  
I shall begin it with a halfpenny, and it shall end with horses and 
yachts and all the fun of the fair.  This is the first real grey 
hair in my character:  rapacity has begun to show, the greed of the 
protuberant guttler.  Well, doubtless, when the hour strikes, we 
must all guttle and protube.  But it comes hard on one who was 
always so willow-slender and as careless as the daisies.
</p><p>Truly I am in excellent spirits.  I have crushed through a 
financial crisis; Fanny is much better; I am in excellent health, 
and work from four to five hours a day - from one to two above my 
average, that is; and we all dwell together and make fortunes in 
the loveliest house you ever saw, with a garden like a fairy story, 
and a view like a classical landscape.
</p><p>Little?  Well, it is not large.  And when you come to see us, you 
will probably have to bed at the hotel, which is hard by.  But it 
is Eden, madam, Eden and Beulah and the Delectable Mountains and 
Eldorado and the Hesperidean Isles and Bimini.
</p><p>We both look forward, my dear friend, with the greatest eagerness 
to have you here.  It seems it is not to be this season; but I 
appoint you with an appointment for next season.  You cannot see us 
else:  remember that.  Till my health has grown solid like an oak-
tree, till my fortune begins really to spread its boughs like the 
same monarch of the woods (and the acorn, ay de mi! is not yet 
planted), I expect to be a prisoner among the palms.
</p><p>Yes, it is like old times to be writing you from the Riviera, and 
after all that has come and gone who can predict anything?  How 
fortune tumbles men about!  Yet I have not found that they change 
their friends, thank God.
</p><p>Both of our loves to your sister and yourself.  As for me, if I am 
here and happy, I know to whom I owe it; I know who made my way for 
me in life, if that were all, and I remain, with love, your 
faithful friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, [APRIL 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I am very guilty; I should have written to you 
long ago; and now, though it must be done, I am so stupid that I 
can only boldly recapitulate.  A phrase of three members is the 
outside of my syntax.
</p><p>First, I liked the ROVER better than any of your other verse.  I 
believe you are right, and can make stories in verse.  The last two 
stanzas and one or two in the beginning - but the two last above 
all - I thought excellent.  I suggest a pursuit of the vein.  If 
you want a good story to treat, get the MEMOIRS OF THE CHEVALIER 
JOHNSTONE, and do his passage of the Tay; it would be excellent:  
the dinner in the field, the woman he has to follow, the dragoons, 
the timid boatmen, the brave lasses.  It would go like a charm; 
look at it, and you will say you owe me one.
</p><p>Second, Gilder asking me for fiction, I suddenly took a great 
resolve, and have packed off to him my new work, THE SILVERADO 
SQUATTERS.  I do not for a moment suppose he will take it; but pray 
say all the good words you can for it.  I should be awfully glad to 
get it taken.  But if it does not mean dibbs at once, I shall be 
ruined for life.  Pray write soon and beg Gilder your prettiest for 
a poor gentleman in pecuniary sloughs.
</p><p>Fourth, next time I am supposed to be at death's door, write to me 
like a Christian, and let not your correspondence attend on 
business. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>P.S. - I see I have led you to conceive the SQUATTERS are fiction.  
They are not, alas!

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET SOLITUDE, MAY 5, [1883].
</p><p>MY DEAREST PEOPLE, - I have had a great piece of news.  There has 
been offered for TREASURE ISLAND - how much do you suppose?  I 
believe it would be an excellent jest to keep the answer till my 
next letter.  For two cents I would do so.  Shall I?  Anyway, I'll 
turn the page first.  No - well - A hundred pounds, all alive, O!  
A hundred jingling, tingling, golden, minted quid.  Is not this 
wonderful?  Add that I have now finished, in draft, the fifteenth 
chapter of my novel, and have only five before me, and you will see 
what cause of gratitude I have.
</p><p>The weather, to look at the per contra sheet, continues vomitable; 
and Fanny is quite out of sorts.  But, really, with such cause of 
gladness, I have not the heart to be dispirited by anything.  My 
child's verse book is finished, dedication and all, and out of my 
hands - you may tell Cummy; SILVERADO is done, too, and cast upon 
the waters; and this novel so near completion, it does look as if I 
should support myself without trouble in the future.  If I have 
only health, I can, I thank God.  It is dreadful to be a great, big 
man, and not be able to buy bread.
</p><p>O that this may last!
</p><p>I have to-day paid my rent for the half year, till the middle of 
September, and got my lease:  why they have been so long, I know 
not.
</p><p>I wish you all sorts of good things.
</p><p>When is our marriage day? - Your loving and ecstatic son,
</p><p>TREESURE EILAAN,
</p><p>It has been for me a Treasure Island verily.

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, MAY 8, 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - I was disgusted to hear my father was not so 
well.  I have a most troubled existence of work and business.  But 
the work goes well, which is the great affair.  I meant to have 
written a most delightful letter; too tired, however, and must 
stop.  Perhaps I'll find time to add to it ere post.
</p><p>I have returned refreshed from eating, but have little time, as 
Lloyd will go soon with the letters on his way to his tutor, Louis 
Robert (!!!!), with whom he learns Latin in French, and French, I 
suppose, in Latin, which seems to me a capital education.  He, 
Lloyd, is a great bicycler already, and has been long distances; he 
is most new-fangled over his instrument, and does not willingly 
converse on other subjects.
</p><p>Our lovely garden is a prey to snails; I have gathered about a 
bushel, which, not having the heart to slay, I steal forth withal 
and deposit near my neighbour's garden wall.  As a case of 
casuistry, this presents many points of interest.  I loathe the 
snails, but from loathing to actual butchery, trucidation of 
multitudes, there is still a step that I hesitate to take.  What, 
then, to do with them?  My neighbour's vineyard, pardy!  It is a 
rich, villa, pleasure-garden of course; if it were a peasant's 
patch, the snails, I suppose, would have to perish.
</p><p>The weather these last three days has been much better, though it 
is still windy and unkind.  I keep splendidly well, and am cruelly 
busy, with mighty little time even for a walk.  And to write at 
all, under such pressure, must be held to lean to virtue's side.
</p><p>My financial prospects are shining.  O if the health will hold, I 
should easily support myself. - Your ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, [MAY 20, 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I enclose the receipt and the corrections.  As for 
your letter and Gilder's, I must take an hour or so to think; the 
matter much importing - to me.  The 40 pounds was a heavenly thing.
</p><p>I send the MS. by Henley, because he acts for me in all matters, 
and had the thing, like all my other books, in his detention.  He 
is my unpaid agent - an admirable arrangement for me, and one that 
has rather more than doubled my income on the spot.
</p><p>If I have been long silent, think how long you were so and blush, 
sir, blush.
</p><p>I was rendered unwell by the arrival of your cheque, and, like 
Pepys, 'my hand still shakes to write of it.'  To this grateful 
emotion, and not to D.T., please attribute the raggedness of my 
hand.
</p><p>This year I should be able to live and keep my family on my own 
earnings, and that in spite of eight months and more of perfect 
idleness at the end of last and beginning of this.  It is a sweet 
thought.
</p><p>This spot, our garden and our view, are sub-celestial.  I sing 
daily with my Bunyan, that great bard,
</p><p><br />
'I dwell already the next door to Heaven!'
</p><p><br />
If you could see my roses, and my aloes, and my fig-marigolds, and 
my olives, and my view over a plain, and my view of certain 
mountains as graceful as Apollo, as severe as Zeus, you would not 
think the phrase exaggerated.
</p><p>It is blowing to-day a HOT mistral, which is the devil or a near 
connection of his.
</p><p>This to catch the post. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, FRANCE, MAY 21, 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - The night giveth advice, generally bad advice; but 
I have taken it.  And I have written direct to Gilder to tell him 
to keep the book back and go on with it in November at his leisure.  
I do not know if this will come in time; if it doesn't, of course 
things will go on in the way proposed.  The 40 pounds, or, as I 
prefer to put it, the 1000 francs, has been such a piercing sun-ray 
as my whole grey life is gilt withal.  On the back of it I can 
endure.  If these good days of LONGMAN and the CENTURY only last, 
it will be a very green world, this that we dwell in and that 
philosophers miscall.  I have no taste for that philosophy; give me 
large sums paid on the receipt of the MS. and copyright reserved, 
and what do I care about the non-beent?  Only I know it can't last.  
The devil always has an imp or two in every house, and my imps are 
getting lively.  The good lady, the dear, kind lady, the sweet, 
excellent lady, Nemesis, whom alone I adore, has fixed her wooden 
eye upon me.  I fall prone; spare me, Mother Nemesis!  But catch 
her!
</p><p>I must now go to bed; for I have had a whoreson influenza cold, and 
have to lie down all day, and get up only to meals and the 
delights, June delights, of business correspondence.
</p><p>You said nothing about my subject for a poem.  Don't you like it?  
My own fishy eye has been fixed on it for prose, but I believe it 
could be thrown out finely in verse, and hence I resign and pass 
the hand.  Twig the compliment? - Yours affectionately

</p><p>. . . THE influenza has busted me a good deal; I have no spring, 
and am headachy.  So, as my good Red Lion Counter begged me for 
another Butcher's Boy - I turned me to - what thinkest 'ou? - to 
Tushery, by the mass!  Ay, friend, a whole tale of tushery.  And 
every tusher tushes me so free, that may I be tushed if the whole 
thing is worth a tush.  THE BLACK ARROW:  A TALE OF TUNSTALL FOREST 
is his name:  tush! a poor thing!
</p><p>Will TREASURE ISLAND proofs be coming soon, think you?
</p><p>I will now make a confession.  It was the sight of your maimed 
strength and masterfulness that begot John Silver in TREASURE 
ISLAND.  Of course, he is not in any other quality or feature the 
least like you; but the idea of the maimed man, ruling and dreaded 
by the sound, was entirely taken from you.
</p><p>Otto is, as you say, not a thing to extend my public on.  It is 
queer and a little, little bit free; and some of the parties are 
immoral; and the whole thing is not a romance, nor yet a comedy; 
nor yet a romantic comedy; but a kind of preparation of some of the 
elements of all three in a glass jar.  I think it is not without 
merit, but I am not always on the level of my argument, and some 
parts are false, and much of the rest is thin; it is more a triumph 
for myself than anything else; for I see, beyond it, better stuff.  
I have nine chapters ready, or almost ready, for press.  My feeling 
would be to get it placed anywhere for as much as could be got for 
it, and rather in the shadow, till one saw the look of it in print.

</p><p>MY DEAR LAD, - The books came some time since, but I have not had 
the pluck to answer:  a shower of small troubles having fallen in, 
or troubles that may be very large.
</p><p>I have had to incur a huge vague debt for cleaning sewers; our 
house was (of course) riddled with hidden cesspools, but that was 
infallible.  I have the fever, and feel the duty to work very heavy 
on me at times; yet go it must.  I have had to leave FONTAINEBLEAU, 
when three hours would finish it, and go full-tilt at tushery for a 
while.  But it will come soon.
</p><p>I think I can give you a good article on Hokusai; but that is for 
afterwards; FONTAINEBLEAU is first in hand
</p><p>By the way, my view is to give the PENNY WHISTLES to Crane or 
Greenaway.  But Crane, I think, is likeliest; he is a fellow who, 
at least, always does his best.
</p><p>Shall I ever have money enough to write a play?  O dire necessity!

May wanton on the spray;
But vain for him who tushes

The clouds are full of rain,
But doomed is he who tushes
To tush and tush again.

Still, 'tush' he says, and weeps;
At night again he tushes,
And tushes till he sleeps.

</p><p>DEAR HENLEY, - You may be surprised to hear that I am now a great 
writer of verses; that is, however, so.  I have the mania now like 
my betters, and faith, if I live till I am forty, I shall have a 
book of rhymes like Pollock, Gosse, or whom you please.  Really, I 
have begun to learn some of the rudiments of that trade, and have 
written three or four pretty enough pieces of octosyllabic 
nonsense, semi-serious, semi-smiling.  A kind of prose Herrick, 
divested of the gift of verse, and you behold the Bard.  But I like 
it.

</p><p>HYERES [JUNE 1883].
</p><p>DEAR LAD, - I was delighted to hear the good news about -.  Bravo, 
he goes uphill fast.  Let him beware of vanity, and he will go 
higher; let him be still discontented, and let him (if it might be) 
see the merits and not the faults of his rivals, and he may swarm 
at last to the top-gallant.  There is no other way.  Admiration is 
the only road to excellence; and the critical spirit kills, but 
envy and injustice are putrefaction on its feet.
</p><p>Thus far the moralist.  The eager author now begs to know whether 
you may have got the other Whistles, and whether a fresh proof is 
to be taken; also whether in that case the dedication should not be 
printed therewith; Bulk Delights Publishers (original aphorism; to 
be said sixteen times in succession as a test of sobriety).
</p><p>Your wild and ravening commands were received; but cannot be 
obeyed.  And anyway, I do assure you I am getting better every day; 
and if the weather would but turn, I should soon be observed to 
walk in hornpipes.  Truly I am on the mend.  I am still very 
careful.  I have the new dictionary; a joy, a thing of beauty, and 
- bulk.  I shall be raked i' the mools before it's finished; that 
is the only pity; but meanwhile I sing.
</p><p>I beg to inform you that I, Robert Louis Stevenson, author of 
BRASHIANA and other works, am merely beginning to commence to 
prepare to make a first start at trying to understand my 
profession.  O the height and depth of novelty and worth in any 
art! and O that I am privileged to swim and shoulder through such 
oceans!  Could one get out of sight of land - all in the blue?  
Alas not, being anchored here in flesh, and the bonds of logic 
being still about us.
</p><p>But what a great space and a great air there is in these small 
shallows where alone we venture! and how new each sight, squall, 
calm, or sunrise!  An art is a fine fortune, a palace in a park, a 
band of music, health, and physical beauty; all but love - to any 
worthy practiser.  I sleep upon my art for a pillow; I waken in my 
art; I am unready for death, because I hate to leave it.  I love my 
wife, I do not know how much, nor can, nor shall, unless I lost 
her; but while I can conceive my being widowed, I refuse the 
offering of life without my art.  I AM not but in my art; it is me; 
I am the body of it merely.
</p><p>And yet I produce nothing, am the author of BRASHIANA and other 
works:  tiddy-iddity - as if the works one wrote were anything but 
'prentice's experiments.  Dear reader, I deceive you with husks, 
the real works and all the pleasure are still mine and 
incommunicable.  After this break in my work, beginning to return 
to it, as from light sleep, I wax exclamatory, as you see.

Green reeds and the sky-scattering river.
A stately music.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES [SUMMER 1883].
</p><p>DEAR LAD, - Glad you like FONTAINEBLEAU.  I am going to be the 
means, under heaven, of aerating or liberating your pages.  The 
idea that because a thing is a picture-book all the writing should 
be on the wrong tack is TRISTE but widespread.  Thus Hokusai will 
be really a gossip on convention, or in great part.  And the Skelt 
will be as like a Charles Lamb as I can get it.  The writer should 
write, and not illustrate pictures:  else it's bosh. . . .
</p><p>Your remarks about the ugly are my eye.  Ugliness is only the prose 
of horror.  It is when you are not able to write MACBETH that you 
write THERESE RAQUIN.  Fashions are external:  the essence of art 
only varies in so far as fashion widens the field of its 
application; art is a mill whose thirlage, in different ages, 
widens and contracts; but, in any case and under any fashion, the 
great man produces beauty, terror, and mirth, and the little man 
produces cleverness (personalities, psychology) instead of beauty, 
ugliness instead of terror, and jokes instead of mirth.  As it was 
in the beginning, is now, and shall be ever, world without end.  
Amen!
</p><p>And even as you read, you say, 'Of course, QUELLE RENGAINE!'

</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES [SUMMER 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR CUMMY, - Yes, I own I am a real bad correspondent, and am 
as bad as can be in most directions.
</p><p>I have been adding some more poems to your book.  I wish they would 
look sharp about it; but, you see, they are trying to find a good 
artist to make the illustrations, without which no child would give 
a kick for it.  It will be quite a fine work, I hope.  The 
dedication is a poem too, and has been quite a long while written, 
but I do not mean you to see it till you get the book; keep the 
jelly for the last, you know, as you would often recommend in 
former days, so now you can take your own medicine.
</p><p>I am very sorry to hear you have been so poorly; I have been very 
well; it used to be quite the other way, used it not?  Do you 
remember making the whistle at Mount Chessie?  I do not think it 
WAS my knife; I believe it was yours; but rhyme is a very great 
monarch, and goes before honesty, in these affairs at least.  Do 
you remember, at Warriston, one autumn Sunday, when the beech nuts 
were on the ground, seeing heaven open?  I would like to make a 
rhyme of that, but cannot.
</p><p>Is it not strange to think of all the changes:  Bob, Cramond, 
Delhi, Minnie, and Henrietta, all married, and fathers and mothers, 
and your humble servant just the one point better off?  And such a 
little while ago all children together!  The time goes swift and 
wonderfully even; and if we are no worse than we are, we should be 
grateful to the power that guides us.  For more than a generation I 
have now been to the fore in this rough world, and been most 
tenderly helped, and done cruelly wrong, and yet escaped; and here 
I am still, the worse for wear, but with some fight in me still, 
and not unthankful - no, surely not unthankful, or I were then the 
worst of human beings!
</p><p>My little dog is a very much better child in every way, both more 
loving and more amiable; but he is not fond of strangers, and is, 
like most of his kind, a great, specious humbug.
</p><p>Fanny has been ill, but is much better again; she now goes donkey 
rides with an old woman, who compliments her on her French.  That 
old woman - seventy odd - is in a parlous spiritual state.
</p><p>Pretty soon, in the new sixpenny illustrated magazine, Wogg's 
picture is to appear:  this is a great honour!  And the poor soul 
whose vanity would just explode if he could understand it, will 
never be a bit the wiser! - With much love, in which Fanny joins, 
believe me, your affectionate boy,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, SUMMER 1883.
</p><p>DEAR LAD, - Snatches in return for yours; for this little once, I'm 
well to windward of you.
</p><p>Seventeen chapters of OTTO are now drafted, and finding I was 
working through my voice and getting screechy, I have turned back 
again to rewrite the earlier part.  It has, I do believe, some 
merit:  of what order, of course, I am the last to know; and, 
triumph of triumphs, my wife - my wife who hates and loathes and 
slates my women - admits a great part of my Countess to be on the 
spot.
</p><p>Yes, I could borrow, but it is the joy of being before the public, 
for once.  Really, 100 pounds is a sight more than TREASURE ISLAND 
is worth.
</p><p>The reason of my DECHE?  Well, if you begin one house, have to 
desert it, begin another, and are eight months without doing any 
work, you will be in a DECHE too.  I am not in a DECHE, however; 
DISTINGUO - I would fain distinguish; I am rather a swell, but NOT 
SOLVENT.  At a touch the edifice, AEDIFICIUM, might collapse.  If 
my creditors began to babble around me, I would sink with a slow 
strain of music into the crimson west.  The difficulty in my 
elegant villa is to find oil, OLEUM, for the dam axles.  But I've 
paid my rent until September; and beyond the chemist, the grocer, 
the baker, the doctor, the gardener, Lloyd's teacher, and the great 
thief creditor Death, I can snap my fingers at all men.  Why will 
people spring bills on you?  I try to make 'em charge me at the 
moment; they won't, the money goes, the debt remains. - The 
Required Play is in the MERRY MEN.
</p><p>Q. E. F.
</p><p>I thus render honour to your FLAIR; it came on me of a clap; I do 
not see it yet beyond a kind of sunset glory.  But it's there:  
passion, romance, the picturesque, involved:  startling, simple, 
horrid:  a sea-pink in sea-froth!  S'AGIT DE LA DESENTERRER.  
'Help!' cries a buried masterpiece.
</p><p>Once I see my way to the year's end, clear, I turn to plays; till 
then I grind at letters; finish OTTO; write, say, a couple of my 
TRAVELLER'S TALES; and then, if all my ships come home, I will 
attack the drama in earnest.  I cannot mix the skeins.  Thus, 
though I'm morally sure there is a play in OTTO, I dare not look 
for it:  I shoot straight at the story.
</p><p>As a story, a comedy, I think OTTO very well constructed; the 
echoes are very good, all the sentiments change round, and the 
points of view are continually, and, I think (if you please), 
happily contrasted.  None of it is exactly funny, but some of it is 
smiling.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES [SUMMER 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I have now leisurely read your volume; pretty 
soon, by the way, you will receive one of mine.
</p><p>It is a pleasant, instructive, and scholarly volume.  The three 
best being, quite out of sight - Crashaw, Otway, and Etherege.  
They are excellent; I hesitate between them; but perhaps Crashaw is 
the most brilliant
</p><p>Your Webster is not my Webster; nor your Herrick my Herrick.  On 
these matters we must fire a gun to leeward, show our colours, and 
go by.  Argument is impossible.  They are two of my favourite 
authors:  Herrick above all:  I suppose they are two of yours.  
Well, Janus-like, they do behold us two with diverse countenances, 
few features are common to these different avatars; and we can but 
agree to differ, but still with gratitude to our entertainers, like 
two guests at the same dinner, one of whom takes clear and one 
white soup.  By my way of thinking, neither of us need be wrong.
</p><p>The other papers are all interesting, adequate, clear, and with a 
pleasant spice of the romantic.  It is a book you may be well 
pleased to have so finished, and will do you much good.  The 
Crashaw is capital:  capital; I like the taste of it.  Preface 
clean and dignified.  The handling throughout workmanlike, with 
some four or five touches of preciosity, which I regret.
</p><p>With my thanks for information, entertainment, and a pleasurable 
envy here and there. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, SEPTEMBER 19, 1883.
</p><p>DEAR BOY, - Our letters vigorously cross:  you will ere this have 
received a note to Coggie:  God knows what was in it.
</p><p>It is strange, a little before the first word you sent me - so late 
- kindly late, I know and feel - I was thinking in my bed, when I 
knew you I had six friends - Bob I had by nature; then came the 
good James Walter - with all his failings - the GENTLEMAN of the 
lot, alas to sink so low, alas to do so little, but now, thank God, 
in his quiet rest; next I found Baxter - well do I remember telling 
Walter I had unearthed 'a W.S. that I thought would do' - it was in 
the Academy Lane, and he questioned me as to the Signet's 
qualifications; fourth came Simpson; somewhere about the same time, 
I began to get intimate with Jenkin; last came Colvin.  Then, one 
black winter afternoon, long Leslie Stephen, in his velvet jacket, 
met me in the SPEC. by appointment, took me over to the infirmary, 
and in the crackling, blighting gaslight showed me that old head 
whose excellent representation I see before me in the photograph.  
Now when a man has six friends, to introduce a seventh is usually 
hopeless.  Yet when you were presented, you took to them and they 
to you upon the nail.  You must have been a fine fellow; but what a 
singular fortune I must have had in my six friends that you should 
take to all.  I don't know if it is good Latin, most probably not:  
but this is enscrolled before my eye for Walter:  TANDEM E NUBIBUS 
IN APRICUM PROPERAT.  Rest, I suppose, I know, was all that 
remained; but O to look back, to remember all the mirth, all the 
kindness, all the humorous limitations and loved defects of that 
character; to think that he was young with me, sharing that 
weather-beaten, Fergussonian youth, looking forward through the 
clouds to the sunburst; and now clean gone from my path, silent - 
well, well.  This has been a strange awakening.  Last night, when I 
was alone in the house, with the window open on the lovely still 
night, I could have sworn he was in the room with me; I could show 
you the spot; and, what was very curious, I heard his rich 
laughter, a thing I had not called to mind for I know not how long.
</p><p>I see his coral waistcoat studs that he wore the first time he 
dined in my house; I see his attitude, leaning back a little, 
already with something of a portly air, and laughing internally.  
How I admired him!  And now in the West Kirk.
</p><p>I am trying to write out this haunting bodily sense of absence; 
besides, what else should I write of?
</p><p>Yes, looking back, I think of him as one who was good, though 
sometimes clouded.  He was the only gentle one of all my friends, 
save perhaps the other Walter.  And he was certainly the only 
modest man among the lot.  He never gave himself away; he kept back 
his secret; there was always a gentle problem behind all.  Dear, 
dear, what a wreck; and yet how pleasant is the retrospect!  God 
doeth all things well, though by what strange, solemn, and 
murderous contrivances!
</p><p>It is strange:  he was the only man I ever loved who did not 
habitually interrupt.  The fact draws my own portrait.  And it is 
one of the many reasons why I count myself honoured by his 
friendship.  A man like you HAD to like me; you could not help 
yourself; but Ferrier was above me, we were not equals; his true 
self humoured and smiled paternally upon my failings, even as I 
humoured and sorrowed over his.
</p><p>Well, first his mother, then himself, they are gone:  'in their 
resting graves.'
</p><p>When I come to think of it, I do not know what I said to his 
sister, and I fear to try again.  Could you send her this?  There 
is too much both about yourself and me in it; but that, if you do 
not mind, is but a mark of sincerity.  It would let her know how 
entirely, in the mind of (I suppose) his oldest friend, the good, 
true Ferrier obliterates the memory of the other, who was only his 
'lunatic brother.'
</p><p>Judge of this for me, and do as you please; anyway, I will try to 
write to her again; my last was some kind of scrawl that I could 
not see for crying.  This came upon me, remember, with terrible 
suddenness; I was surprised by this death; and it is fifteen or 
sixteen years since first I saw the handsome face in the SPEC.  I 
made sure, besides, to have died first.  Love to you, your wife, 
and her sisters.
</p><p>- Ever yours, dear boy,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>I never knew any man so superior to himself as poor James Walter.  
The best of him only came as a vision, like Corsica from the 
Corniche.  He never gave his measure either morally or 
intellectually.  The curse was on him.  Even his friends did not 
know him but by fits.  I have passed hours with him when he was so 
wise, good, and sweet, that I never knew the like of it in any 
other.  And for a beautiful good humour he had no match.  I 
remember breaking in upon him once with a whole red-hot story (in 
my worst manner), pouring words upon him by the hour about some 
truck not worth an egg that had befallen me; and suddenly, some 
half hour after, finding that the sweet fellow had some concern of 
his own of infinitely greater import, that he was patiently and 
smilingly waiting to consult me on.  It sounds nothing; but the 
courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect.  It makes me rage to 
think how few knew him, and how many had the chance to sneer at 
their better.
</p><p>Well, he was not wasted, that we know; though if anything looked 
liker irony than this fitting of a man out with these rich 
qualities and faculties to be wrecked and aborted from the very 
stocks, I do not know the name of it.  Yet we see that he has left 
an influence; the memory of his patient courtesy has often checked 
me in rudeness; has it not you?
</p><p>You can form no idea of how handsome Walter was.  At twenty he was 
splendid to see; then, too, he had the sense of power in him, and 
great hopes; he looked forward, ever jesting of course, but he 
looked to see himself where he had the right to expect.  He 
believed in himself profoundly; but HE NEVER DISBELIEVED IN OTHERS.  
To the roughest Highland student he always had his fine, kind, open 
dignity of manner; and a good word behind his back.
</p><p>The last time that I saw him before leaving for America - it was a 
sad blow to both of us.  When he heard I was leaving, and that 
might be the last time we might meet - it almost was so - he was 
terribly upset, and came round at once.  We sat late, in Baxter's 
empty house, where I was sleeping.  My dear friend Walter Ferrier:  
O if I had only written to him more! if only one of us in these 
last days had been well!  But I ever cherished the honour of his 
friendship, and now when he is gone, I know what I have lost still 
better.  We live on, meaning to meet; but when the hope is gone, 
the, pang comes.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, 26TH SEPTEMBER 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - It appears a bolt from Transatlantica is necessary 
to produce four lines from you.  It is not flattering; but as I was 
always a bad correspondent, 'tis a vice to which I am lenient.  I 
give you to know, however, that I have already twice (this makes 
three times) sent you what I please to call a letter, and received 
from you in return a subterfuge - or nothing. . . .
</p><p>My present purpose, however, which must not be postponed, is to ask 
you to telegraph to the Americans.
</p><p>After a summer of good health of a very radiant order, toothache 
and the death of a very old friend, which came upon me like a 
thunderclap, have rather shelved my powers.  I stare upon the 
paper, not write.  I wish I could write like your Sculptors; yet I 
am well aware that I should not try in that direction.  A certain 
warmth (tepid enough) and a certain dash of the picturesque are my 
poor essential qualities; and if I went fooling after the too 
classical, I might lose even these.  But I envied you that page.
</p><p>I am, of course, deep in schemes; I was so ever.  Execution alone 
somewhat halts.  How much do you make per annum, I wonder?  This 
year, for the first time, I shall pass 300 pounds; I may even get 
halfway to the next milestone.  This seems but a faint 
remuneration; and the devil of it is, that I manage, with sickness, 
and moves, and education, and the like, to keep steadily in front 
of my income.  However, I console myself with this, that if I were 
anything else under God's Heaven, and had the same crank health, I 
should make an even zero.  If I had, with my present knowledge, 
twelve months of my old health, I would, could, and should do 
something neat.  As it is, I have to tinker at my things in little 
sittings; and the rent, or the butcher, or something, is always 
calling me off to rattle up a pot-boiler.  And then comes a back-
set of my health, and I have to twiddle my fingers and play 
patience.
</p><p>Well, I do not complain, but I do envy strong health where it is 
squandered.  Treasure your strength, and may you never learn by 
experience the profound ENNUI and irritation of the shelved artist.  
For then, what is life?  All that one has done to make one's life 
effective then doubles the itch of inefficiency.
</p><p>I trust also you may be long without finding out the devil that 
there is in a bereavement.  After love it is the one great surprise 
that life preserves for us.  Now I don't think I can be astonished 
any more. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR [OCTOBER 1883].
</p><p>COLVIN, COLVIN, COLVIN, - Yours received; also interesting copy of 
P. WHISTLES.  'In the multitude of councillors the Bible declares 
there is wisdom,' said my great-uncle, 'but I have always found in 
them distraction.'  It is extraordinary how tastes vary:  these 
proofs have been handed about, it appears, and I have had several 
letters; and - distraction. 'AEsop:  the Miller and the Ass.'  
Notes on details:-
</p><p>1. I love the occasional trochaic line; and so did many excellent 
writers before me.
</p><p>2. If you don't like 'A Good Boy,' I do.
</p><p>3. In 'Escape at Bedtime,' I found two suggestions.  'Shove' for 
'above' is a correction of the press; it was so written.  
'Twinkled' is just the error; to the child the stars appear to be 
there; any word that suggests illusion is a horror.
</p><p>4. I don't care; I take a different view of the vocative.
</p><p>5. Bewildering and childering are good enough for me.  These are 
rhymes, jingles; I don't go for eternity and the three unities.
</p><p>I will delete some of those condemned, but not all.  I don't care 
for the name Penny Whistles; I sent a sheaf to Henley when I sent 
'em.  But I've forgot the others.  I would just as soon call 'em 
'Rimes for Children' as anything else.  I am not proud nor 
particular.
</p><p>Your remarks on the BLACK ARROW are to the point.  I am pleased you 
liked Crookback; he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always 
fired my attention.  I wish Shakespeare had written the play after 
he had learned some of the rudiments of literature and art rather 
than before.  Some day, I will re-tickle the Sable Missile, and 
shoot it, MOYENNANT FINANCES, once more into the air; I can lighten 
it of much, and devote some more attention to Dick o' Gloucester.  
It's great sport to write tushery.
</p><p>By this I reckon you will have heard of my proposed excursiolorum 
to the Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece, and kindred sites.  If 
the excursiolorum goes on, that is, if MOYENNANT FINANCES comes 
off, I shall write to beg you to collect introductiolorums for me.
</p><p>Distinguo:  1. SILVERADO was not written in America, but in 
Switzerland's icy mountains.  2. What you read is the bleeding and 
disembowelled remains of what I wrote.  3. The good stuff is all to 
come - so I think.  'The Sea Fogs,' 'The Hunter's Family,' 'Toils 
and Pleasures' - BELLES PAGES. - Yours ever,
</p><p>RAMNUGGER.
</p><p>O! - Seeley is too clever to live, and the book a gem.  But why has 
he read too much Arnold?  Why will he avoid - obviously avoid - 
fine writing up to which he has led?  This is a winking, curled-
and-oiled, ultra-cultured, Oxford-don sort of an affectation that 
infuriates my honest soul.  'You see' - they say - 'how unbombastic 
WE are; we come right up to eloquence, and, when it's hanging on 
the pen, dammy, we scorn it!'  It is literary Deronda-ism.  If you 
don't want the woman, the image, or the phrase, mortify your vanity 
and avoid the appearance of wanting them.

<p>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, OCTOBER [1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - . . . Some day or other, in Cassell's MAGAZINE OF 
ART, you will see a paper which will interest you, and where your 
name appears.  It is called 'Fontainebleau:  Village Communities of 
Artists,' and the signature of R. L. Stevenson will be found 
annexed
</p><p>Please tell the editor of MANHATTAN the following secrets for me:  
1ST, That I am a beast; 2ND, that I owe him a letter; 3RD, that I 
have lost his, and cannot recall either his name or address; 4TH, 
that I am very deep in engagements, which my absurd health makes it 
hard for me to overtake; but 5TH, that I will bear him in mind; 6TH 
and last, that I am a brute.
</p><p>My address is still the same, and I live in a most sweet corner of 
the universe, sea and fine hills before me, and a rich variegated 
plain; and at my back a craggy hill, loaded with vast feudal ruins.  
I am very quiet; a person passing by my door half startles me; but 
I enjoy the most aromatic airs, and at night the most wonderful 
view into a moonlit garden.  By day this garden fades into nothing, 
overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance; but at 
night and when the moon is out, that garden, the arbour, the flight 
of stairs that mount the artificial hillock, the plumed blue gum-
trees that hang trembling, become the very skirts of Paradise.  
Angels I know frequent it; and it thrills all night with the flutes 
of silence.  Damn that garden;- and by day it is gone.
</p><p>Continue to testify boldly against realism.  Down with Dagon, the 
fish god!  All art swings down towards imitation, in these days, 
fatally.  But the man who loves art with wisdom sees the joke; it 
is the lustful that tremble and respect her ladyship; but the 
honest and romantic lovers of the Muse can see a joke and sit down 
to laugh with Apollo.
</p><p>The prospect of your return to Europe is very agreeable; and I was 
pleased by what you said about your parents.  One of my oldest 
friends died recently, and this has given me new thoughts of death.  
Up to now I had rather thought of him as a mere personal enemy of 
my own; but now that I see him hunting after my friends, he looks 
altogether darker.  My own father is not well; and Henley, of whom 
you must have heard me speak, is in a questionable state of health.  
These things are very solemn, and take some of the colour out of 
life.  It is a great thing, after all, to be a man of reasonable 
honour and kindness.  Do you remember once consulting me in Paris 
whether you had not better sacrifice honesty to art; and how, after 
much confabulation, we agreed that your art would suffer if you 
did?  We decided better than we knew.  In this strange welter where 
we live, all hangs together by a million filaments; and to do 
reasonably well by others, is the first prerequisite of art.  Art 
is a virtue; and if I were the man I should be, my art would rise 
in the proportion of my life.
</p><p>If you were privileged to give some happiness to your parents, I 
know your art will gain by it.  BY GOD, IT WILL!  SIC SUBSCRIBITUR,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS [OCTOBER 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR BOB, - Yes, I got both your letters at Lyons, but have been 
since then decading in several steps Toothache; fever; Ferrier's 
death; lung.  Now it is decided I am to leave to-morrow, penniless, 
for Nice to see Dr. Williams.
</p><p>I was much struck by your last.  I have written a breathless note 
on Realism for Henley; a fifth part of the subject, hurriedly 
touched, which will show you how my thoughts are driving.  You are 
now at last beginning to think upon the problems of executive, 
plastic art, for you are now for the first time attacking them.  
Hitherto you have spoken and thought of two things - technique and 
the ARS ARTIUM, or common background of all arts.  Studio work is 
the real touch.  That is the genial error of the present French 
teaching.  Realism I regard as a mere question of method.  The 
'brown foreground,' 'old mastery,' and the like, ranking with 
villanelles, as technical sports and pastimes.  Real art, whether 
ideal or realistic, addresses precisely the same feeling, and seeks 
the same qualities - significance or charm.  And the same - very 
same - inspiration is only methodically differentiated according as 
the artist is an arrant realist or an arrant idealist.  Each, by 
his own method, seeks to save and perpetuate the same significance 
or charm; the one by suppressing, the other by forcing, detail.  
All other idealism is the brown foreground over again, and hence 
only art in the sense of a game, like cup and ball.  All other 
realism is not art at all - but not at all.  It is, then, an 
insincere and showy handicraft.
</p><p>Were you to re-read some Balzac, as I have been doing, it would 
greatly help to clear your eyes.  He was a man who never found his 
method.  An inarticulate Shakespeare, smothered under forcible-
feeble detail.  It is astounding to the riper mind how bad he is, 
how feeble, how untrue, how tedious; and, of course, when he 
surrendered to his temperament, how good and powerful.  And yet 
never plain nor clear.  He could not consent to be dull, and thus 
became so.  He would leave nothing undeveloped, and thus drowned 
out of sight of land amid the multitude of crying and incongruous 
details.  There is but one art - to omit!  O if I knew how to omit, 
I would ask no other knowledge.  A man who knew how to omit would 
make an ILIAD of a daily paper.
</p><p>Your definition of seeing is quite right.  It is the first part of 
omission to be partly blind.  Artistic sight is judicious 
blindness.  Sam Bough must have been a jolly blind old boy.  He 
would turn a corner, look for one-half or quarter minute, and then 
say, 'This'll do, lad.'  Down he sat, there and then, with whole 
artistic plan, scheme of colour, and the like, and begin by laying 
a foundation of powerful and seemingly incongruous colour on the 
block.  He saw, not the scene, but the water-colour sketch.  Every 
artist by sixty should so behold nature.  Where does he learn that?  
In the studio, I swear.  He goes to nature for facts, relations, 
values - material; as a man, before writing a historical novel, 
reads up memoirs.  But it is not by reading memoirs that he has 
learned the selective criterion.  He has learned that in the 
practice of his art; and he will never learn it well, but when 
disengaged from the ardent struggle of immediate representation, of 
realistic and EX FACTO art.  He learns it in the crystallisation of 
day-dreams; in changing, not in copying, fact; in the pursuit of 
the ideal, not in the study of nature.  These temples of art are, 
as you say, inaccessible to the realistic climber.  It is not by 
looking at the sea that you get
</p><p><br />
'The multitudinous seas incarnadine,'
</p><p><br />
nor by looking at Mont Blanc that you find
</p><p><br />
'And visited all night by troops of stars.'
</p><p><br />
A kind of ardour of the blood is the mother of all this; and 
according as this ardour is swayed by knowledge and seconded by 
craft, the art expression flows clear, and significance and charm, 
like a moon rising, are born above the barren juggle of mere 
symbols.
</p><p>The painter must study more from nature than the man of words.  But 
why?  Because literature deals with men's business and passions 
which, in the game of life, we are irresistibly obliged to study; 
but painting with relations of light, and colour, and 
significances, and form, which, from the immemorial habit of the 
race, we pass over with an unregardful eye.  Hence this crouching 
upon camp-stools, and these crusts.  But neither one nor other is a 
part of art, only preliminary studies.
</p><p>I want you to help me to get people to understand that realism is a 
method, and only methodic in its consequences; when the realist is 
an artist, that is, and supposing the idealist with whom you 
compare him to be anything but a FARCEUR and a DILETTANTE.  The two 
schools of working do, and should, lead to the choice of different 
subjects.  But that is a consequence, not a cause.  See my chaotic 
note, which will appear, I fancy, in November in Henley's sheet.
</p><p>Poor Ferrier, it bust me horrid.  He was, after you, the oldest of 
my friends.
</p><p>I am now very tired, and will go to bed having prelected freely.  
Fanny will finish.

<p>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, 12TH OCTOBER 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - I have just lunched; the day is exquisite, the 
air comes though the open window rich with odour, and I am by no 
means spiritually minded.  Your letter, however, was very much 
valued, and has been read oftener than once.  What you say about 
yourself I was glad to hear; a little decent resignation is not 
only becoming a Christian, but is likely to be excellent for the 
health of a Stevenson.  To fret and fume is undignified, suicidally 
foolish, and theologically unpardonable; we are here not to make, 
but to tread predestined, pathways; we are the foam of a wave, and 
to preserve a proper equanimity is not merely the first part of 
submission to God, but the chief of possible kindnesses to those 
about us.  I am lecturing myself, but you also.  To do our best is 
one part, but to wash our hands smilingly of the consequence is the 
next part, of any sensible virtue.
</p><p>I have come, for the moment, to a pause in my moral works; for I 
have many irons in the fire, and I wish to finish something to 
bring coin before I can afford to go on with what I think 
doubtfully to be a duty.  It is a most difficult work; a touch of 
the parson will drive off those I hope to influence; a touch of 
overstrained laxity, besides disgusting, like a grimace, may do 
harm.  Nothing that I have ever seen yet speaks directly and 
efficaciously to young men; and I do hope I may find the art and 
wisdom to fill up a gap.  The great point, as I see it, is to ask 
as little as possible, and meet, if it may be, every view or 
absence of view; and it should be, must be, easy.  Honesty is the 
one desideratum; but think how hard a one to meet.  I think all the 
time of Ferrier and myself; these are the pair that I address.  
Poor Ferrier, so much a better man than I, and such a temporal 
wreck.  But the thing of which we must divest our minds is to look 
partially upon others; all is to be viewed; and the creature 
judged, as he must be by his Creator, not dissected through a prism 
of morals, but in the unrefracted ray.  So seen, and in relation to 
the almost omnipotent surroundings, who is to distinguish between 
F. and such a man as Dr. Candlish, or between such a man as David 
Hume and such an one as Robert Burns?  To compare my poor and good 
Walter with myself is to make me startle; he, upon all grounds 
above the merely expedient, was the nobler being.  Yet wrecked 
utterly ere the full age of manhood; and the last skirmishes so 
well fought, so humanly useless, so pathetically brave, only the 
leaps of an expiring lamp.  All this is a very pointed instance.  
It shuts the mouth.  I have learned more, in some ways, from him 
than from any other soul I ever met; and he, strange to think, was 
the best gentleman, in all kinder senses, that I ever knew. - Ever 
your affectionate son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W H LOW
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, OCT. 23, 1883.]
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - C'EST D'UN BON CAMARADE; and I am much obliged to 
you for your two letters and the inclosure.  Times are a lityle 
changed with all of us since the ever memorable days of Lavenue:  
hallowed be his name! hallowed his old Fleury! - of which you did 
not see - I think - as I did - the glorious apotheosis:  advanced 
on a Tuesday to three francs, on the Thursday to six, and on Friday 
swept off, holus bolus, for the proprietor's private consumption.  
Well, we had the start of that proprietor.  Many a good bottle came 
our way, and was, I think, worthily made welcome.
</p><p>I am pleased that Mr. Gilder should like my literature; and I ask 
you particularly to thank Mr. Bunner (have I the name right?) for 
his notice, which was of that friendly, headlong sort that really 
pleases an author like what the French call a 'shake-hands.'  It 
pleased me the more coming from the States, where I have met not 
much recognition, save from the buccaneers, and above all from 
pirates who misspell my name.  I saw my book advertised in a number 
of the CRITIC as the work of one R. L. Stephenson; and, I own, I 
boiled.  It is so easy to know the name of the man whose book you 
have stolen; for there it is, at full length, on the title-page of 
your booty.  But no, damn him, not he!  He calls me Stephenson.  
These woes I only refer to by the way, as they set a higher value 
on the CENTURY notice.
</p><p>I am now a person with an established ill-health - a wife - a dog 
possessed with an evil, a Gadarene spirit - a chalet on a hill, 
looking out over the Mediterranean - a certain reputation - and 
very obscure finances.  Otherwise, very much the same, I guess; and 
were a bottle of Fleury a thing to be obtained, capable of 
developing theories along with a fit spirit even as of yore.  Yet I 
now draw near to the Middle Ages; nearly three years ago, that 
fatal Thirty struck; and yet the great work is not yet done - not 
yet even conceived.  But so, as one goes on, the wood seems to 
thicken, the footpath to narrow, and the House Beautiful on the 
hill's summit to draw further and further away.  We learn, indeed, 
to use our means; but only to learn, along with it, the paralysing 
knowledge that these means are only applicable to two or three poor 
commonplace motives.  Eight years ago, if I could have slung ink as 
I can now, I should have thought myself well on the road after 
Shakespeare; and now - I find I have only got a pair of walking-
shoes and not yet begun to travel.  And art is still away there on 
the mountain summit.  But I need not continue; for, of course, this 
is your story just as much as it is mine; and, strange to think, it 
was Shakespeare's too, and Beethoven's, and Phidias's.  It is a 
blessed thing that, in this forest of art, we can pursue our wood-
lice and sparrows, AND NOT CATCH THEM, with almost the same fervour 
of exhilaration as that with which Sophocles hunted and brought 
down the Mastodon.
</p><p>Tell me something of your work, and your wife. - My dear fellow, I 
am yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>My wife begs to be remembered to both of you; I cannot say as much 
for my dog, who has never seen you, but he would like, on general 
principles, to bite you.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HYERES, NOVEMBER 1883.]
</p><p>MY DEAR LAD, - . . .  Of course, my seamanship is jimmy:  did I not 
beseech you I know not how often to find me an ancient mariner - 
and you, whose own wife's own brother is one of the ancientest, did 
nothing for me?  As for my seamen, did Runciman ever know 
eighteenth century buccaneers?  No?  Well, no more did I.  But I 
have known and sailed with seamen too, and lived and eaten with 
them; and I made my put-up shot in no great ignorance, but as a 
put-up thing has to be made, I.E. to be coherent and picturesque, 
and damn the expense.  Are they fairly lively on the wires?  Then, 
favour me with your tongues.  Are they wooden, and dim, and no 
sport?  Then it is I that am silent, otherwise not.  The work, 
strange as it may sound in the ear, is not a work of realism.  The 
next thing I shall hear is that the etiquette is wrong in Otto's 
Court!  With a warrant, and I mean it to be so, and the whole 
matter never cost me half a thought.  I make these paper people to 
please myself, and Skelt, and God Almighty, and with no ulterior 
purpose.  Yet am I mortal myself; for, as I remind you, I begged 
for a supervising mariner.  However, my heart is in the right 
place.  I have been to sea, but I never crossed the threshold of a 
court; and the courts shall be the way I want 'em.
</p><p>I'm glad to think I owe you the review that pleased me best of all 
the reviews I ever had; the one I liked best before that was -'s on 
the ARABIANS.  These two are the flowers of the collection, 
according to me.  To live reading such reviews and die eating 
ortolans - sich is my aspiration.
</p><p>Whenever you come you will be equally welcome.  I am trying to 
finish OTTO ere you shall arrive, so as to take and be able to 
enjoy a well-earned - O yes, a well-earned - holiday.  Longman 
fetched by Otto:  is it a spoon or a spoilt horn?  Momentous, if 
the latter; if the former, a spoon to dip much praise and pudding, 
and to give, I do think, much pleasure.  The last part, now in 
hand, much smiles upon me. - Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, [NOVEMBER 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - You must not blame me too much for my silence; I 
am over head and ears in work, and do not know what to do first.  I 
have been hard at OTTO, hard at SILVERADO proofs, which I have 
worked over again to a tremendous extent; cutting, adding, 
rewriting, until some of the worst chapters of the original are 
now, to my mind, as good as any.  I was the more bound to make it 
good, as I had such liberal terms; it's not for want of trying if I 
have failed.
</p><p>I got your letter on my birthday; indeed, that was how I found it 
out about three in the afternoon, when postie comes.  Thank you for 
all you said.  As for my wife, that was the best investment ever 
made by man; but 'in our branch of the family' we seem to marry 
well.  I, considering my piles of work, am wonderfully well; I have 
not been so busy for I know not how long.  I hope you will send me 
the money I asked however, as I am not only penniless, but shall 
remain so in all human probability for some considerable time.  I 
have got in the mass of my expectations; and the 100 pounds which 
is to float us on the new year can not come due till SILVERADO is 
all ready; I am delaying it myself for the moment; then will follow 
the binders and the travellers and an infinity of other nuisances; 
and only at the last, the jingling-tingling.
</p><p>Do you know that TREASURE ISLAND has appeared?  In the November 
number of Henley's Magazine, a capital number anyway, there is a 
funny publisher's puff of it for your book; also a bad article by 
me.  Lang dotes on TREASURE ISLAND:  'Except TOM SAWYER and the 
ODYSSEY,' he writes, 'I never liked any romance so much.'  I will 
inclose the letter though.  The Bogue is angelic, although very 
dirty.  It has rained - at last!  It was jolly cold when the rain 
came.
</p><p>I was overjoyed to hear such good news of my father.  Let him go on 
at that!  Ever your affectionate,

righteous spirit.
</p><p>I continue my uphill fight with the twin spirits of bankruptcy and 
indigestion.  Duns rage about my portal, at least to fancy's ear.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MRS. MILNE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, [NOVEMBER 1883].
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRIETTA, - Certainly; who else would they be?  More by 
token, on that particular occasion, you were sailing under the 
title of Princess Royal; I, after a furious contest, under that of 
Prince Alfred; and Willie, still a little sulky, as the Prince of 
Wales.  We were all in a buck basket about half-way between the 
swing and the gate; and I can still see the Pirate Squadron heave 
in sight upon the weather bow.
</p><p>I wrote a piece besides on Giant Bunker; but I was not happily 
inspired, and it is condemned.  Perhaps I'll try again; he was a 
horrid fellow, Giant Bunker! and some of my happiest hours were 
passed in pursuit of him.  You were a capital fellow to play:  how 
few there were who could!  None better than yourself.  I shall 
never forget some of the days at Bridge of Allan; they were one 
golden dream.  See 'A Good Boy' in the PENNY WHISTLES, much of the 
sentiment of which is taken direct from one evening at B. of A. 
when we had had a great play with the little Glasgow girl.  
Hallowed be that fat book of fairy tales!  Do you remember acting 
the Fair One with Golden Locks?  What a romantic drama!  Generally 
speaking, whenever I think of play, it is pretty certain that you 
will come into my head.  I wrote a paper called 'Child's Play' 
once, where, I believe, you or Willie would recognise things. . . .
</p><p>Surely Willie is just the man to marry; and if his wife wasn't a 
happy woman, I think I could tell her who was to blame.  Is there 
no word of it?  Well, these things are beyond arrangement; and the 
wind bloweth where it listeth - which, I observe, is generally 
towards the west in Scotland.  Here it prefers a south-easterly 
course, and is called the Mistral - usually with an adjective in 
front.  But if you will remember my yesterday's toothache and this 
morning's crick, you will be in a position to choose an adjective 
for yourself.  Not that the wind is unhealthy; only when it comes 
strong, it is both very high and very cold, which makes it the d-v-
l.  But as I am writing to a lady, I had better avoid this topic; 
winds requiring a great scope of language.
</p><p>Please remember me to all at home; give Ramsay a pennyworth of 
acidulated drops for his good taste. - And believe me, your 
affectionate cousin,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MISS FERRIER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, VAR, NOVEMBER 22, 1883.
</p><p>DEAR MISS FERRIER, - Many thanks for the photograph.  It is - well, 
it is like most photographs.  The sun is an artist of too much 
renown; and, at any rate, we who knew Walter 'in the brave days of 
old' will be difficult to please.
</p><p>I was inexpressibly touched to get a letter from some lawyers as to 
some money.  I have never had any account with my friends; some 
have gained and some lost; and I should feel there was something 
dishonest in a partial liquidation even if I could recollect the 
facts, WHICH I CANNOT.  But the fact of his having put aside this 
memorandum touched me greatly.
</p><p>The mystery of his life is great.  Our chemist in this place, who 
had been at Malvern, recognised the picture.  You may remember 
Walter had a romantic affection for all pharmacies? and the bottles 
in the window were for him a poem?  He said once that he knew no 
pleasure like driving through a lamplit city, waiting for the 
chemists to go by.
</p><p>All these things return now.
</p><p>He had a pretty full translation of Schiller's AESTHETIC LETTERS, 
which we read together, as well as the second part of FAUST, in 
Gladstone Terrace, he helping me with the German.  There is no 
keepsake I should more value than the MS. of that translation.  
They were the best days I ever had with him, little dreaming all 
would so soon be over.  It needs a blow like this to convict a man 
of mortality and its burthen.  I always thought I should go by 
myself; not to survive.  But now I feel as if the earth were 
undermined, and all my friends have lost one thickness of reality 
since that one passed.  Those are happy who can take it otherwise; 
with that I found things all beginning to dislimn.  Here we have no 
abiding city, and one felt as though he had - and O too much acted.
</p><p>But if you tell me, he did not feel my silence.  However, he must 
have done so; and my guilt is irreparable now.  I thank God at 
least heartily that he did not resent it.
</p><p>Please remember me to Sir Alexander and Lady Grant, to whose care I 
will address this.  When next I am in Edinburgh I will take 
flowers, alas! to the West Kirk.  Many a long hour we passed in 
graveyards, the man who has gone and I - or rather not that man - 
but the beautiful, genial, witty youth who so betrayed him. - Dear 
Miss Ferrier, I am yours most sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, VAR, 13TH DECEMBER 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - . . . I was much pleased with what you send about my 
work.  Ill-health is a great handicapper in the race.  I have never 
at command that press of spirits that are necessary to strike out a 
thing red-hot.  SILVERADO is an example of stuff worried and pawed 
about, God knows how often, in poor health, and you can see for 
yourself the result:  good pages, an imperfect fusion, a certain 
languor of the whole.  Not, in short, art.  I have told Roberts to 
send you a copy of the book when it appears, where there are some 
fair passages that will be new to you.  My brief romance, PRINCE 
OTTO - far my most difficult adventure up to now - is near an end.  
I have still one chapter to write DE FOND EN COMBLE, and three or 
four to strengthen or recast.  The rest is done.  I do not know if 
I have made a spoon, or only spoiled a horn; but I am tempted to 
hope the first.  If the present bargain hold, it will not see the 
light of day for some thirteen months.  Then I shall be glad to 
know how it strikes you.  There is a good deal of stuff in it, both 
dramatic and, I think, poetic; and the story is not like these 
purposeless fables of to-day, but is, at least, intended to stand 
FIRM upon a base of philosophy - or morals - as you please.  It has 
been long gestated, and is wrought with care.  ENFIN, NOUS VERRONS.  
My labours have this year for the first time been rewarded with 
upwards of 350 pounds; that of itself, so base we are! encourages 
me; and the better tenor of my health yet more. - Remember me to 
Mrs. Low, and believe me, yours most sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, DECEMBER 20, 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - I do not know which of us is to blame; I suspect 
it is you this time.  The last accounts of you were pretty good, I 
was pleased to see; I am, on the whole, very well - suffering a 
little still from my fever and liver complications, but better.
</p><p>I have just finished re-reading a book, which I counsel you above 
all things NOT to read, as it has made me very ill, and would make 
you worse - Lockhart's SCOTT.  It is worth reading, as all things 
are from time to time that keep us nose to nose with fact; though I 
think such reading may be abused, and that a great deal of life is 
better spent in reading of a light and yet chivalrous strain.  
Thus, no Waverley novel approaches in power, blackness, bitterness, 
and moral elevation to the diary and Lockhart's narrative of the 
end; and yet the Waverley novels are better reading for every day 
than the Life.  You may take a tonic daily, but not phlebotomy.
</p><p>The great double danger of taking life too easily, and taking it 
too hard, how difficult it is to balance that!  But we are all too 
little inclined to faith; we are all, in our serious moments, too 
much inclined to forget that all are sinners, and fall justly by 
their faults, and therefore that we have no more to do with that 
than with the thunder-cloud; only to trust, and do our best, and 
wear as smiling a face as may be for others and ourselves.  But 
there is no royal road among this complicated business.  Hegel the 
German got the best word of all philosophy with his antinomies:  
the contrary of everything is its postulate.  That is, of course, 
grossly expressed, but gives a hint of the idea, which contains a 
great deal of the mysteries of religion, and a vast amount of the 
practical wisdom of life.  For your part, there is no doubt as to 
your duty - to take things easy and be as happy as you can, for 
your sake, and my mother's, and that of many besides.  Excuse this 
sermon. - Ever your loving son,

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, DECEMBER 25, 1883.
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER, - This it is supposed will reach you 
about Christmas, and I believe I should include Lloyd in the 
greeting.  But I want to lecture my father; he is not grateful 
enough; he is like Fanny; his resignation is not the 'true blue.'  
A man who has gained a stone; whose son is better, and, after so 
many fears to the contrary, I dare to say, a credit to him; whose 
business is arranged; whose marriage is a picture - what I should 
call resignation in such a case as his would be to 'take down his 
fiddle and play as lood as ever he could.'  That and nought else.  
And now, you dear old pious ingrate, on this Christmas morning, 
think what your mercies have been; and do not walk too far before 
your breakfast - as far as to the top of India Street, then to the 
top of Dundas Street, and then to your ain stair heid; and do not 
forget that even as LABORARE, so JOCULARI, EST ORARE; and to be 
happy the first step to being pious.
</p><p>I have as good as finished my novel, and a hard job it has been - 
but now practically over,  LAUS DEO!  My financial prospects better 
than ever before; my excellent wife a touch dolorous, like Mr. 
Tommy; my Bogue quite converted, and myself in good spirits.  O, 
send Curry Powder per Baxter.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[LA SOLITUDE, HYERES], LAST SUNDAY OF '83.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I give my father up.  I give him a parable:  that 
the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the 
tragic Life.  And he takes it backside foremost, and shakes his 
head, and is gloomier than ever.  Tell him that I give him up.  I 
don't want no such a parent.  This is not the man for my money.  I 
do not call that by the name of religion which fills a man with 
bile.  I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, 
and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an 
answer - Perish the thought of it.
</p><p>Here am I on the threshold of another year, when, according to all 
human foresight, I should long ago have been resolved into my 
elements; here am I, who you were persuaded was born to disgrace 
you - and, I will do you the justice to add, on no such 
insufficient grounds - no very burning discredit when all is done; 
here am I married, and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of 
the first order, A1 at Lloyd's.  There is he, at his not first 
youth, able to take more exercise than I at thirty-three, and 
gaining a stone's weight, a thing of which I am incapable.  There 
are you; has the man no gratitude?  There is Smeoroch:  is he 
blind?  Tell him from me that all this is
</p><p>NOT THE TRUE BLUE!
</p><p>I will think more of his prayers when I see in him a spirit of 
PRAISE.  Piety is a more childlike and happy attitude than he 
admits.  Martha, Martha, do you hear the knocking at the door?  But 
Mary was happy.  Even the Shorter Catechism, not the merriest 
epitome of religion, and a work exactly as pious although not quite 
so true as the multiplication table - even that dry-as-dust epitome 
begins with a heroic note.  What is man's chief end?  Let him study 
that; and ask himself if to refuse to enjoy God's kindest gifts is 
in the spirit indicated.  Up, Dullard!  It is better service to 
enjoy a novel than to mump.
</p><p>I have been most unjust to the Shorter Catechism, I perceive.  I 
wish to say that I keenly admire its merits as a performance; and 
that all that was in my mind was its peculiarly unreligious and 
unmoral texture; from which defect it can never, of course, 
exercise the least influence on the minds of children.  But they 
learn fine style and some austere thinking unconsciously. - Ever 
your loving son,

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, JANUARY 1 (1884).
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - A Good New Year to you.  The year closes, leaving 
me with 50 pounds in the bank, owing no man nothing, 100 pounds 
more due to me in a week or so, and 150 pounds more in the course 
of the month; and I can look back on a total receipt of 465 pounds, 
0s. 6d. for the last twelve months!
</p><p>And yet I am not happy!
</p><p>Yet I beg!  Here is my beggary:-
</p><p>1. Sellar's Trial.
2. George Borrow's Book about Wales.
3. My Grandfather's Trip to Holland.
4. And (but this is, I fear, impossible) the Bell Rock Book.
</p><p>When I think of how last year began, after four months of sickness 
and idleness, all my plans gone to water, myself starting alone, a 
kind of spectre, for Nice - should I not be grateful?  Come, let us 
sing unto the Lord!
</p><p>Nor should I forget the expected visit, but I will not believe in 
that till it befall; I am no cultivator of disappointments, 'tis a 
herb that does not grow in my garden; but I get some good crops 
both of remorse and gratitude.  The last I can recommend to all 
gardeners; it grows best in shiny weather, but once well grown, is 
very hardy; it does not require much labour; only that the 
husbandman should smoke his pipe about the flower-plots and admire 
God's pleasant wonders.  Winter green (otherwise known as 
Resignation, or the 'false gratitude plant') springs in much the 
same soil; is little hardier, if at all; and requires to be so dug 
about and dunged, that there is little margin left for profit.  The 
variety known as the Black Winter green (H. V. Stevensoniana) is 
rather for ornament than profit.
</p><p>'John, do you see that bed of resignation?' - 'It's doin' bravely, 
sir.' - 'John, I will not have it in my garden; it flatters not the 
eye and comforts not the stomach; root it out.' - 'Sir, I ha'e seen 
o' them that rase as high as nettles; gran' plants!' - 'What then?  
Were they as tall as alps, if still unsavoury and bleak, what 
matters it?  Out with it, then; and in its place put Laughter and a 
Good Conceit (that capital home evergreen), and a bush of Flowering 
Piety - but see it be the flowering sort - the other species is no 
ornament to any gentleman's Back Garden.'

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, 9TH MARCH 1884.
</p><p>MY DEAR S. C., - You will already have received a not very sane 
note from me; so your patience was rewarded - may I say, your 
patient silence?  However, now comes a letter, which on receipt, I 
thus acknowledge.
</p><p>I have already expressed myself as to the political aspect.  About 
Grahame, I feel happier; it does seem to have been really a good, 
neat, honest piece of work.  We do not seem to be so badly off for 
commanders:  Wolseley and Roberts, and this pile of Woods, 
Stewarts, Alisons, Grahames, and the like.  Had we but ONE 
statesman on any side of the house!
</p><p>Two chapters of OTTO do remain:  one to rewrite, one to create; and 
I am not yet able to tackle them.  For me it is my chief o' works; 
hence probably not so for others, since it only means that I have 
here attacked the greatest difficulties.  But some chapters towards 
the end:  three in particular - I do think come off.  I find them 
stirring, dramatic, and not unpoetical.  We shall see, however; as 
like as not, the effort will be more obvious than the success.  
For, of course, I strung myself hard to carry it out.  The next 
will come easier, and possibly be more popular.  I believe in the 
covering of much paper, each time with a definite and not too 
difficult artistic purpose; and then, from time to time, drawing 
oneself up and trying, in a superior effort, to combine the 
facilities thus acquired or improved.  Thus one progresses.  But, 
mind, it is very likely that the big effort, instead of being the 
masterpiece, may be the blotted copy, the gymnastic exercise.  This 
no man can tell; only the brutal and licentious public, snouting in 
Mudie's wash-trough, can return a dubious answer.
</p><p>I am to-day, thanks to a pure heaven and a beneficent, loud-
talking, antiseptic mistral, on the high places as to health and 
spirits.  Money holds out wonderfully.  Fanny has gone for a drive 
to certain meadows which are now one sheet of jonquils:  sea-bound 
meadows, the thought of which may freshen you in Bloomsbury.  'Ye 
have been fresh and fair, Ye have been filled with flowers' - I 
fear I misquote.  Why do people babble?  Surely Herrick, in his 
true vein, is superior to Martial himself, though Martial is a very 
pretty poet.
</p><p>Did you ever read St. Augustine?  The first chapters of the 
CONFESSIONS are marked by a commanding genius.  Shakespearian in 
depth.  I was struck dumb, but, alas! when you begin to wander into 
controversy, the poet drops out.  His description of infancy is 
most seizing.  And how is this:  'Sed majorum nugae negotia 
vocantur; puerorum autem talia cum sint puniuntur a majoribus.'  
Which is quite after the heart of R. L. S.  See also his splendid 
passage about the 'luminosus limes amicitiae' and the 'nebulae de 
limosa concupiscentia carnis'; going on 'UTRUMQUE in confuso 
aestuabat et rapiebat imbecillam aetatem per abrupta cupiditatum.'  
That 'Utrumque' is a real contribution to life's science.  Lust 
ALONE is but a pigmy; but it never, or rarely, attacks us single-
handed.
</p><p>Do you ever read (to go miles off, indeed) the incredible Barbey 
d'Aurevilly?  A psychological Poe - to be for a moment Henley.  I 
own with pleasure I prefer him with all his folly, rot, sentiment, 
and mixed metaphors, to the whole modern school in France.  It 
makes me laugh when it's nonsense; and when he gets an effect 
(though it's still nonsense and mere Poery, not poesy) it wakens 
me.  CE QUI NE MEURT PAS nearly killed me with laughing, and left 
me - well, it left me very nearly admiring the old ass.  At least, 
it's the kind of thing one feels one couldn't do.  The dreadful 
moonlight, when they all three sit silent in the room - by George, 
sir, it's imagined - and the brief scene between the husband and 
wife is all there.  QUANT AU FOND, the whole thing, of course, is a 
fever dream, and worthy of eternal laughter.  Had the young man 
broken stones, and the two women been hard-working honest 
prostitutes, there had been an end of the whole immoral and 
baseless business:  you could at least have respected them in that 
case.
</p><p>I also read PETRONIUS ARBITER, which is a rum work, not so immoral 
as most modern works, but singularly silly.  I tackled some Tacitus 
too.  I got them with a dreadful French crib on the same page with 
the text, which helps me along and drives me mad.  The French do 
not even try to translate.  They try to be much more classical than 
the classics, with astounding results of barrenness and tedium.  
Tacitus, I fear, was too solid for me.  I liked the war part; but 
the dreary intriguing at Rome was too much.

<p>Letter:  TO MR. DICK
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, VAR, 12TH MARCH 1884.
</p><p>MY DEAR MR. DICK, - I have been a great while owing you a letter; 
but I am not without excuses, as you have heard.  I overworked to 
get a piece of work finished before I had my holiday, thinking to 
enjoy it more; and instead of that, the machinery near hand came 
sundry in my hands! like Murdie's uniform.  However, I am now, I 
think, in a fair way of recovery; I think I was made, what there is 
of me, of whipcord and thorn-switches; surely I am tough!  But I 
fancy I shall not overdrive again, or not so long.  It is my theory 
that work is highly beneficial, but that it should, if possible, 
and certainly for such partially broken-down instruments as the 
thing I call my body, be taken in batches, with a clear break and 
breathing space between.  I always do vary my work, laying one 
thing aside to take up another, not merely because I believe it 
rests the brain, but because I have found it most beneficial to the 
result.  Reading, Bacon says, makes a full man, but what makes me 
full on any subject is to banish it for a time from all my 
thoughts.  However, what I now propose is, out of every quarter, to 
work two months' and rest the third.  I believe I shall get more 
done, as I generally manage, on my present scheme, to have four 
months' impotent illness and two of imperfect health - one before, 
one after, I break down.  This, at least, is not an economical 
division of the year.
</p><p>I re-read the other day that heartbreaking book, the LIFE OF SCOTT.  
One should read such works now and then, but O, not often.  As I 
live, I feel more and more that literature should be cheerful and 
brave-spirited, even if it cannot be made beautiful and pious and 
heroic.  We wish it to be a green place; the WAVERLEY NOVELS are 
better to re-read than the over-true life, fine as dear Sir Walter 
was.  The Bible, in most parts, is a cheerful book; it is our 
little piping theologies, tracts, and sermons that are dull and 
dowie; and even the Shorter Catechism, which is scarcely a work of 
consolation, opens with the best and shortest and completest sermon 
ever written - upon Man's chief end. - Believe me, my dear Mr. 
Dick, very sincerely yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - You see I have changed my hand.  I was threatened apparently 
with scrivener's cramp, and at any rate had got to write so small, 
that the revisal of my MS. tried my eyes, hence my signature alone 
remains upon the old model; for it appears that if I changed that, 
I should be cut off from my 'vivers.'

<p>Letter:  TO COSMO MONKHOUSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, MARCH 16, 1884.
</p><p>MY DEAR MONKHOUSE, - You see with what promptitude I plunge into 
correspondence; but the truth is, I am condemned to a complete 
inaction, stagnate dismally, and love a letter.  Yours, which would 
have been welcome at any time, was thus doubly precious.
</p><p>Dover sounds somewhat shiveringly in my ears.  You should see the 
weather I have - cloudless, clear as crystal, with just a punkah-
draft of the most aromatic air, all pine and gum tree.  You would 
be ashamed of Dover; you would scruple to refer, sir, to a spot so 
paltry.  To be idle at Dover is a strange pretension; pray, how do 
you warm yourself?  If I were there I should grind knives or write 
blank verse, or -  But at least you do not bathe?  It is idle to 
deny it:  I have - I may say I nourish - a growing jealousy of the 
robust, large-legged, healthy Britain-dwellers, patient of grog, 
scorners of the timid umbrella, innocuously breathing fog:  all 
which I once was, and I am ashamed to say liked it.  How ignorant 
is youth! grossly rolling among unselected pleasures; and how 
nobler, purer, sweeter, and lighter, to sip the choice tonic, to 
recline in the luxurious invalid chair, and to tread, well-shawled, 
the little round of the constitutional.  Seriously, do you like to 
repose?  Ye gods, I hate it.  I never rest with any acceptation; I 
do not know what people mean who say they like sleep and that 
damned bedtime which, since long ere I was breeched, has rung a 
knell to all my day's doings and beings.  And when a man, seemingly 
sane, tells me he has 'fallen in love with stagnation,' I can only 
say to him, 'You will never be a Pirate!'  This may not cause any 
regret to Mrs. Monkhouse; but in your own soul it will clang hollow 
- think of it!  Never!  After all boyhood's aspirations and youth's 
immoral day-dreams, you are condemned to sit down, grossly draw in 
your chair to the fat board, and be a beastly Burgess till you die.  
Can it be?  Is there not some escape, some furlough from the Moral 
Law, some holiday jaunt contrivable into a Better Land?  Shall we 
never shed blood?  This prospect is too grey.
</p><p><br />
'Here lies a man who never did
Anything but what he was bid;
Who lived his life in paltry ease,
And died of commonplace disease.'
</p><p><br />
To confess plainly, I had intended to spend my life (or any leisure 
I might have from Piracy upon the high seas) as the leader of a 
great horde of irregular cavalry, devastating whole valleys.  I can 
still, looking back, see myself in many favourite attitudes; 
signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pocket-
handkerchief, I at the jetty end, and one or two of my bold blades 
keeping the crowd at bay; or else turning in the saddle to look 
back at my whole command (some five thousand strong) following me 
at the hand-gallop up the road out of the burning valley:  this 
last by moonlight.
</p><p>ET POINT DU TOUT.  I am a poor scribe, and have scarce broken a 
commandment to mention, and have recently dined upon cold veal!  As 
for you (who probably had some ambitions), I hear of you living at 
Dover, in lodgings, like the beasts of the field.  But in heaven, 
when we get there, we shall have a good time, and see some real 
carnage.  For heaven is - must be - that great Kingdom of 
Antinomia, which Lamb saw dimly adumbrated in the COUNTRY WIFE, 
where the worm which never dies (the conscience) peacefully 
expires, and the sinner lies down beside the Ten Commandments.  
Till then, here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling, with neither 
health nor vice for anything more spirited than procrastination, 
which I may well call the Consolation Stakes of Wickedness; and by 
whose diligent practice, without the least amusement to ourselves, 
we can rob the orphan and bring down grey hairs with sorrow to the 
dust.
</p><p>This astonishing gush of nonsense I now hasten to close, envelope, 
and expedite to Shakespeare's Cliff.  Remember me to Shakespeare, 
and believe me, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, MARCH 17, 1884.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Your office - office is profanely said - your 
bower upon the leads is divine.  Have you, like Pepys, 'the right 
to fiddle' there?  I see you mount the companion, barbiton in hand, 
and, fluttered about by city sparrows, pour forth your spirit in a 
voluntary.  Now when the spring begins, you must lay in your 
flowers:  how do you say about a potted hawthorn?  Would it bloom?  
Wallflower is a choice pot-herb; lily-of-the-valley, too, and 
carnation, and Indian cress trailed about the window, is not only 
beautiful by colour, but the leaves are good to eat.  I recommend 
thyme and rosemary for the aroma, which should not be left upon one 
side; they are good quiet growths.
</p><p>On one of your tables keep a great map spread out; a chart is still 
better - it takes one further - the havens with their little 
anchors, the rocks, banks, and soundings, are adorably marine; and 
such furniture will suit your ship-shape habitation.  I wish I 
could see those cabins; they smile upon me with the most intimate 
charm.  From your leads, do you behold St. Paul's?  I always like 
to see the Foolscap; it is London PER SE and no spot from which it 
is visible is without romance.  Then it is good company for the man 
of letters, whose veritable nursing Pater-Noster is so near at 
hand.
</p><p>I am all at a standstill; as idle as a painted ship, but not so 
pretty.  My romance, which has so nearly butchered me in the 
writing, not even finished; though so near, thank God, that a few 
days of tolerable strength will see the roof upon that structure.  
I have worked very hard at it, and so do not expect any great 
public favour.  IN MOMENTS OF EFFORT, ONE LEARNS TO DO THE EASY 
THINGS THAT PEOPLE LIKE.  There is the golden maxim; thus one 
should strain and then play, strain again and play again.  The 
strain is for us, it educates; the play is for the reader, and 
pleases.  Do you not feel so?  We are ever threatened by two 
contrary faults:  both deadly.  To sink into what my forefathers 
would have called 'rank conformity,' and to pour forth cheap 
replicas, upon the one hand; upon the other, and still more 
insidiously present, to forget that art is a diversion and a 
decoration, that no triumph or effort is of value, nor anything 
worth reaching except charm. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MISS FERRIER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, [MARCH 22, 1884].
</p><p>MY DEAR MISS FERRIER, - Are you really going to fall us?  This 
seems a dreadful thing.  My poor wife, who is not well off for 
friends on this bare coast, has been promising herself, and I have 
been promising her, a rare acquisition.  And now Miss Burn has 
failed, and you utter a very doubtful note.  You do not know how 
delightful this place is, nor how anxious we are for a visit.  Look 
at the names:  'The Solitude' - is that romantic?  The palm-trees? 
- how is that for the gorgeous East?  'Var'? the name of a river - 
'the quiet waters by'!  'Tis true, they are in another department, 
and consist of stones and a biennial spate; but what a music, what 
a plash of brooks, for the imagination!  We have hills; we have 
skies; the roses are putting forth, as yet sparsely; the meadows by 
the sea are one sheet of jonquils; the birds sing as in an English 
May - for, considering we are in France and serve up our song-
birds, I am ashamed to say, on a little field of toast and with a 
sprig of thyme (my own receipt) in their most innocent and now 
unvocal bellies - considering all this, we have a wonderfully fair 
wood-music round this Solitude of ours.  What can I say more? - All 
this awaits you.  KENNST DU DAS LAND, in short. - Your sincere 
friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, [APRIL 1884].
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - The blind man in these sprawled lines sends 
greeting.  I have been ill, as perhaps the papers told you.  The 
news - 'great news - glorious news - sec-ond ed-ition!' - went the 
round in England.
</p><p>Anyway, I now thank you for your pictures, which, particularly the 
Arcadian one, we all (Bob included, he was here sick-nursing me) 
much liked.
</p><p>Herewith are a set of verses which I thought pretty enough to send 
to press.  Then I thought of the MANHATTAN, towards whom I have 
guilty and compunctious feelings.  Last, I had the best thought of 
all - to send them to you in case you might think them suitable for 
illustration.  It seemed to me quite in your vein.  If so, good; if 
not, hand them on to MANHATTAN, CENTURY, or LIPPINCOTT, at your 
pleasure, as all three desire my work or pretend to.  But I trust 
the lines will not go unattended.  Some riverside will haunt you; 
and O! be tender to my bathing girls.  The lines are copied in my 
wife's hand, as I cannot see to write otherwise than with the pen 
of Cormoran, Gargantua, or Nimrod.  Love to your wife. - Yours 
ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>Copied it myself.

<p>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, APRIL 19, 1884.
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - Yesterday I very powerfully stated the HERESIS 
STEVENSONIANA, or the complete body of divinity of the family 
theologian, to Miss Ferrier.  She was much impressed; so was I.  
You are a great heresiarch; and I know no better.  Whaur the devil 
did ye get thon about the soap?  Is it altogether your own?  I 
never heard it elsewhere; and yet I suspect it must have been held 
at some time or other, and if you were to look up you would 
probably find yourself condemned by some Council.
</p><p>I am glad to hear you are so well.  The hear is excellent.  The 
CORNHILLS came; I made Miss Ferrier read us 'Thrawn Janet,' and was 
quite bowled over by my own works.  The 'Merry Men' I mean to make 
much longer, with a whole new denouement, not yet quite clear to 
me.  'The Story of a Lie,' I must rewrite entirely also, as it is 
too weak and ragged, yet is worth saving for the Admiral.  Did I 
ever tell you that the Admiral was recognised in America?
</p><p>When they are all on their legs this will make an excellent 
collection.
</p><p>Has Davie never read GUY MANNERING, ROB ROY, or THE ANTIQUARY?  All 
of which are worth three WAVERLEYS.  I think KENILWORTH better than 
WAVERLEY; NIGEL, too; and QUENTIN DURWARD about as good.  But it 
shows a true piece of insight to prefer WAVERLEY, for it IS 
different; and though not quite coherent, better worked in parts 
than almost any other:  surely more carefully.  It is undeniable 
that the love of the slap-dash and the shoddy grew upon Scott with 
success.  Perhaps it does on many of us, which may be the granite 
on which D.'s opinion stands.  However, I hold it, in Patrick 
Walker's phrase, for an 'old, condemned, damnable error.'  Dr. 
Simson was condemned by P. W. as being 'a bagful of' such.  One of 
Patrick's amenities!
</p><p>Another ground there may be to D.'s opinion; those who avoid (or 
seek to avoid) Scott's facility are apt to be continually straining 
and torturing their style to get in more of life.  And to many the 
extra significance does not redeem the strain.

<p>Letter:  TO COSMO MONKHOUSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES, [APRIL 24, 1884].
</p><p>DEAR MONKHOUSE, - If you are in love with repose, here is your 
occasion:  change with me.  I am too blind to read, hence no 
reading; I am too weak to walk, hence no walking; I am not allowed 
to speak, hence no talking; but the great simplification has yet to 
be named; for, if this goes on, I shall soon have nothing to eat - 
and hence, O Hallelujah! hence no eating.  The offer is a fair one:  
I have not sold myself to the devil, for I could never find him.  I 
am married, but so are you.  I sometimes write verses, but so do 
you.  Come!  HIC QUIES!  As for the commandments, I have broken 
them so small that they are the dust of my chambers; you walk upon 
them, triturate and toothless; and with the Golosh of Philosophy, 
they shall not bite your heel.  True, the tenement is falling.  Ay, 
friend, but yours also.  Take a larger view; what is a year or two? 
dust in the balance!  'Tis done, behold you Cosmo Stevenson, and me 
R. L. Monkhouse; you at Hyeres, I in London; you rejoicing in the 
clammiest repose, me proceeding to tear your tabernacle into rags, 
as I have already so admirably torn my own.
</p><p>My place to which I now introduce you - it is yours - is like a 
London house, high and very narrow; upon the lungs I will not 
linger; the heart is large enough for a ballroom; the belly greedy 
and inefficient; the brain stocked with the most damnable 
explosives, like a dynamiter's den.  The whole place is well 
furnished, though not in a very pure taste; Corinthian much of it; 
showy and not strong.
</p><p>About your place I shall try to find my way alone, an interesting 
exploration.  Imagine me, as I go to bed, falling over a blood-
stained remorse; opening that cupboard in the cerebellum and being 
welcomed by the spirit of your murdered uncle.  I should probably 
not like your remorses; I wonder if you will like mine; I have a 
spirited assortment; they whistle in my ear o' nights like a north-
easter.  I trust yours don't dine with the family; mine are better 
mannered; you will hear nought of them till, 2 A.M., except one, to 
be sure, that I have made a pet of, but he is small; I keep him in 
buttons, so as to avoid commentaries; you will like him much - if 
you like what is genuine.
</p><p>Must we likewise change religions?  Mine is a good article, with a 
trick of stopping; cathedral bell note; ornamental dial; supported 
by Venus and the Graces; quite a summer-parlour piety.  Of yours, 
since your last, I fear there is little to be said.
</p><p>There is one article I wish to take away with me:  my spirits.  
They suit me.  I don't want yours; I like my own; I have had them a 
long while in bottle.  It is my only reservation. - Yours (as you 
decide),
</p><p>R. L. MONKHOUSE.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HYERES, MAY 1884.
</p><p>DEAR BOY, - OLD MORTALITY is out, and I am glad to say Coggie likes 
it.  We like her immensely.
</p><p>I keep better, but no great shakes yet; cannot work - cannot:  that 
is flat, not even verses:  as for prose, that more active place is 
shut on me long since.
</p><p>My view of life is essentially the comic; and the romantically 
comic.  AS YOU LIKE IT is to me the most bird-haunted spot in 
letters; TEMPEST and TWELFTH NIGHT follow.  These are what I mean 
by poetry and nature.  I make an effort of my mind to be quite one 
with Moliere, except upon the stage, where his inimitable JEUX DE 
SCENE beggar belief; but you will observe they are stage-plays - 
things AD HOC; not great Olympian debauches of the heart and fancy; 
hence more perfect, and not so great.  Then I come, after great 
wanderings, to Carmosine and to Fantasio; to one part of La 
Derniere Aldini (which, by the by, we might dramatise in a week), 
to the notes that Meredith has found, Evan and the postillion, Evan 
and Rose, Harry in Germany.  And to me these things are the good; 
beauty, touched with sex and laughter; beauty with God's earth for 
the background.  Tragedy does not seem to me to come off; and when 
it does, it does so by the heroic illusion; the anti-masque has 
been omitted; laughter, which attends on all our steps in life, and 
sits by the deathbed, and certainly redacts the epitaph, laughter 
has been lost from these great-hearted lies.  But the comedy which 
keeps the beauty and touches the terrors of our life (laughter and 
tragedy-in-a-good-humour having kissed), that is the last word of 
moved representation; embracing the greatest number of elements of 
fate and character; and telling its story, not with the one eye of 
pity, but with the two of pity and mirth.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>FROM MY BED, MAY 29, 1884.
</p><p>DEAR GOSSE, - The news of the Professorate found me in the article 
of - well, of heads or tails; I am still in bed, and a very poor 
person.  You must thus excuse my damned delay; but, I assure you, I 
was delighted.  You will believe me the more, if I confess to you 
that my first sentiment was envy; yes, sir, on my blood-boltered 
couch I envied the professor.  However, it was not of long 
duration; the double thought that you deserved and that you would 
thoroughly enjoy your success fell like balsam on my wounds.  How 
came it that you never communicated my rejection of Gilder's offer 
for the Rhone?  But it matters not.  Such earthly vanities are over 
for the present.  This has been a fine well-conducted illness.  A 
month in bed; a month of silence; a fortnight of not stirring my 
right hand; a month of not moving without being lifted.  Come!  CA 
Y EST:  devilish like being dead. - Yours, dear Professor, 
academically,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>I am soon to be moved to Royat; an invalid valet goes with me!  I 
got him cheap - second-hand.
</p><p>In turning over my late friend Ferrier's commonplace book, I find 
three poems from VIOL AND FLUTE copied out in his hand:  'When 
Flower-time,' 'Love in Winter,' and 'Mistrust.'  They are capital 
too.  But I thought the fact would interest you.  He was no poetist 
either; so it means the more.  'Love in W.!' I like the best.

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL CHABASSIERE, ROYAT, [JULY 1884].
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - The weather has been demoniac; I have had a skiff 
of cold, and was finally obliged to take to bed entirely; to-day, 
however, it has cleared, the sun shines, and I begin to
</p><p>(SEVERAL DAYS AFTER.)
</p><p>I have been out once, but now am back in bed.  I am better, and 
keep better, but the weather is a mere injustice.  The imitation of 
Edinburgh is, at times, deceptive; there is a note among the 
chimney pots that suggests Howe Street; though I think the 
shrillest spot in Christendom was not upon the Howe Street side, 
but in front, just under the Miss Graemes' big chimney stack.  It 
had a fine alto character - a sort of bleat that used to divide the 
marrow in my joints - say in the wee, slack hours.  That music is 
now lost to us by rebuilding; another air that I remember, not 
regret, was the solo of the gas-burner in the little front room; a 
knickering, flighty, fleering, and yet spectral cackle.  I mind it 
above all on winter afternoons, late, when the window was blue and 
spotted with rare rain-drops, and, looking out, the cold evening 
was seen blue all over, with the lamps of Queen's and Frederick's 
Street dotting it with yellow, and flaring east-ward in the 
squalls.  Heavens, how unhappy I have been in such circumstances - 
I, who have now positively forgotten the colour of unhappiness; who 
am full like a fed ox, and dull like a fresh turf, and have no more 
spiritual life, for good or evil, than a French bagman.
</p><p>We are at Chabassiere's, for of course it was nonsense to go up the 
hill when we could not walk.
</p><p>The child's poems in a far extended form are likely soon to be 
heard of - which Cummy I dare say will be glad to know.  They will 
make a book of about one hundred pages. - Ever your affectionate,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[ROYAT, JULY 1884.]
</p><p>. . . HERE is a quaint thing, I have read ROBINSON, COLONEL JACK, 
MOLL FLANDERS, MEMOIRS OF A CAVALIER, HISTORY OF THE PLAGUE, 
HISTORY OF THE GREAT STORM, SCOTCH CHURCH AND UNION.  And there my 
knowledge of Defoe ends - except a book, the name of which I 
forget, about Peterborough in Spain, which Defoe obviously did not 
write, and could not have written if he wanted.  To which of these 
does B. J. refer?  I guess it must be the history of the Scottish 
Church.  I jest; for, of course, I KNOW it must be a book I have 
never read, and which this makes me keen to read - I mean CAPTAIN 
SINGLETON.  Can it be got and sent to me?  If TREASURE ISLAND is at 
all like it, it will be delightful.  I was just the other day 
wondering at my folly in not remembering it, when I was writing T. 
I., as a mine for pirate tips.  T. I. came out of Kingsley's AT 
LAST, where I got the Dead Man's Chest - and that was the seed - 
and out of the great Captain Johnson's HISTORY OF NOTORIOUS 
PIRATES.  The scenery is Californian in part, and in part CHIC.
</p><p>I was downstairs to-day!  So now I am a made man - till the next 
time.
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>If it was CAPTAIN SINGLETON, send it to me, won't you?
</p><p>LATER. - My life dwindles into a kind of valley of the shadow 
picnic.  I cannot read; so much of the time (as to-day) I must not 
speak above my breath, that to play patience, or to see my wife 
play it, is become the be-all and the end-all of my dim career.  To 
add to my gaiety, I may write letters, but there are few to answer.  
Patience and Poesy are thus my rod and staff; with these I not 
unpleasantly support my days.
</p><p>I am very dim, dumb, dowie, and damnable.  I hate to be silenced; 
and if to talk by signs is my forte (as I contend), to understand 
them cannot be my wife's.  Do not think me unhappy; I have not been 
so for years; but I am blurred, inhabit the debatable frontier of 
sleep, and have but dim designs upon activity.  All is at a 
standstill; books closed, paper put aside, the voice, the eternal 
voice of R. L. S., well silenced.  Hence this plaint reaches you 
with no very great meaning, no very great purpose, and written part 
in slumber by a heavy, dull, somnolent, superannuated son of a 
bedpost.
