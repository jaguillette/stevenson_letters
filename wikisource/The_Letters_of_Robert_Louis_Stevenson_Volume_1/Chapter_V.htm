Letter:  TO A. G. DEW-SMITH
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, NOVEMBER 1880.]
</p><p>Figure me to yourself, I pray -
A man of my peculiar cut -
Apart from dancing and deray,
Into an Alpine valley shut;
</p><p>Shut in a kind of damned Hotel,
Discountenanced by God and man;
The food? - Sir, you would do as well
To cram your belly full of bran.
</p><p>The company?  Alas, the day
That I should dwell with such a crew,
With devil anything to say,
Nor any one to say it to!
</p><p>The place?  Although they call it Platz,
I will be bold and state my view;
It's not a place at all - and that's
The bottom verity, my Dew.
</p><p>There are, as I will not deny,
Innumerable inns; a road;
Several Alps indifferent high;
The snow's inviolable abode;
</p><p>Eleven English parsons, all
Entirely inoffensive; four
True human beings - what I call
Human - the deuce a cipher more;
</p><p>A climate of surprising worth;
Innumerable dogs that bark;
Some air, some weather, and some earth;
A native race - God save the mark! -
</p><p>A race that works, yet cannot work,
Yodels, but cannot yodel right,
Such as, unhelp'd, with rusty dirk,
I vow that I could wholly smite.
</p><p>A river that from morn to night
Down all the valley plays the fool;
Not once she pauses in her flight,
Nor knows the comfort of a pool;
</p><p>But still keeps up, by straight or bend,
The selfsame pace she hath begun -
Still hurry, hurry, to the end -
Good God, is that the way to run?
</p><p>If I a river were, I hope
That I should better realise
The opportunities and scope
Of that romantic enterprise.
</p><p>I should not ape the merely strange,
But aim besides at the divine;
And continuity and change
I still should labour to combine.
</p><p>Here should I gallop down the race,
Here charge the sterling like a bull;
There, as a man might wipe his face,
Lie, pleased and panting, in a pool.
</p><p>But what, my Dew, in idle mood,
What prate I, minding not my debt?
What do I talk of bad or good?
The best is still a cigarette.
</p><p>Me whether evil fate assault,
Or smiling providences crown -
Whether on high the eternal vault
Be blue, or crash with thunder down -
</p><p>I judge the best, whate'er befall,
Is still to sit on one's behind,
And, having duly moistened all,
Smoke with an unperturbed mind.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE], DAVOS, DECEMBER 12 [1880].
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - Here is the scheme as well as I can foresee.  I 
begin the book immediately after the '15, as then began the attempt 
to suppress the Highlands.
</p><p>I. THIRTY YEARS' INTERVAL
</p><p>(1) Rob Roy.
(2) The Independent Companies:  the Watches.
(3) Story of Lady Grange.
(4) The Military Roads, and Disarmament:  Wade and
(5) Burt.
</p><p>II. THE HEROIC AGE
</p><p>(1) Duncan Forbes of Culloden.
(2) Flora Macdonald.
(3) The Forfeited Estates; including Hereditary Jurisdictions; and 
the admirable conduct of the tenants.
</p><p>III. LITERATURE HERE INTERVENES
</p><p>(1) The Ossianic Controversy.
(2) Boswell and Johnson.
(3) Mrs. Grant of Laggan.
</p><p>IV. ECONOMY
</p><p>(1) Highland Economics.
(2) The Reinstatement of the Proprietors.
(3) The Evictions.
(4) Emigration.
(5) Present State.
</p><p>V. RELIGION
</p><p>(1) The Catholics, Episcopals, and Kirk, and Soc. Prop. Christ. 
Knowledge.
(2) The Men.
(3) The Disruption.
</p><p>All this, of course, will greatly change in form, scope, and order; 
this is just a bird's-eye glance.  Thank you for BURT, which came, 
and for your Union notes.  I have read one-half (about 900 pages) 
of Wodrow's CORRESPONDENCE, with some improvement, but great 
fatigue.  The doctor thinks well of my recovery, which puts me in 
good hope for the future.  I should certainly be able to make a 
fine history of this.
</p><p>My Essays are going through the press, and should be out in January 
or February. - Ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS PLATZ [DEC. 6, 1880].
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - I have many letters that I ought to write in 
preference to this; but a duty to letters and to you prevails over 
any private consideration.  You are going to collect odes; I could 
not wish a better man to do so; but I tremble lest you should 
commit two sins of omission.  You will not, I am sure, be so far 
left to yourself as to give us no more of Dryden than the hackneyed 
St. Cecilia; I know you will give us some others of those 
surprising masterpieces where there is more sustained eloquence and 
harmony of English numbers than in all that has been written since; 
there is a machine about a poetical young lady, and another about 
either Charles or James, I know not which; and they are both 
indescribably fine.  (Is Marvell's Horatian Ode good enough?  I 
half think so.)  But my great point is a fear that you are one of 
those who are unjust to our old Tennyson's Duke of Wellington.  I 
have just been talking it over with Symonds; and we agreed that 
whether for its metrical effects, for its brief, plain, stirring 
words of portraiture, as - he 'that never lost an English gun,' or 
- the soldier salute; or for the heroic apostrophe to Nelson; that 
ode has never been surpassed in any tongue or time.  Grant me the 
Duke, O Weg!  I suppose you must not put in yours about the 
warship; you will have to admit worse ones, however. - Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE], DAVOS, DEC. 19, 1880.
</p><p>This letter is a report of a long sederunt, also steterunt in small 
committee at Davos Platz, Dec. 15, 1880.
</p><p>Its results are unhesitatingly shot at your head.
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - We both insist on the Duke of Wellington.  Really it 
cannot be left out.  Symonds said you would cover yourself with 
shame, and I add, your friends with confusion, if you leave it out.  
Really, you know it is the only thing you have, since Dryden, where 
that irregular odic, odal, odous (?) verse is used with mastery and 
sense.  And it's one of our few English blood-boilers.
</p><p>(2) Byron:  if anything:  PROMETHEUS.
</p><p>(3) Shelley (1) THE WORLD'S GREAT AGE from Hellas; we are both dead 
on.  After that you have, of course, THE WEST WIND thing.  But we 
think (1) would maybe be enough; no more than two any way.
</p><p>(4) Herrick.  MEDDOWES and COME, MY CORINNA.  After that MR. 
WICKES:  two any way.
</p><p>(5) Leave out stanza 3rd of Congreve's thing, like a dear; we can't 
stand the 'sigh' nor the 'peruke.'
</p><p>(6) Milton.  TIME and the SOLEMN MUSIC.  We both agree we would 
rather go without L'Allegro and Il Penseroso than these; for the 
reason that these are not so well known to the brutish herd.
</p><p>(7) Is the ROYAL GEORGE an ode, or only an elegy?  It's so good.
</p><p>(8) We leave Campbell to you.
</p><p>(9) If you take anything from Clough, but we don't either of us 
fancy you will, let it be COME BACK.
</p><p>(10) Quite right about Dryden.  I had a hankering after THRENODIA 
AUGUSTALIS; but I find it long and with very prosaic holes:  
though, O! what fine stuff between whiles.
</p><p>(11) Right with Collins.
</p><p>(12) Right about Pope's Ode.  But what can you give?  THE DYING 
CHRISTIAN? or one of his inimitable courtesies?  These last are 
fairly odes, by the Horatian model, just as my dear MEDDOWES is an 
ode in the name and for the sake of Bandusia.
</p><p>(13) Whatever you do, you'll give us the Greek Vase.
</p><p>(14) Do you like Jonson's 'loathed stage'?  Verses 2, 3, and 4 are 
so bad, also the last line.  But there is a fine movement and 
feeling in the rest.
</p><p>We will have the Duke of Wellington by God.  Pro Symonds and 
Stevenson.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO CHARLES WARREN STODDARD
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS PLATZ, SWITZERLAND [DECEMBER 1880].
</p><p>DEAR CHARLES WARREN STODDARD, - Many thanks to you for the letter 
and the photograph.  Will you think it mean if I ask you to wait 
till there appears a promised cheap edition?  Possibly the canny 
Scot does feel pleasure in the superior cheapness; but the true 
reason is this, that I think to put a few words, by way of notes, 
to each book in its new form, because that will be the Standard 
Edition, without which no g.'s l. will be complete.  The edition, 
briefly, SINE QUA NON.  Before that, I shall hope to send you my 
essays, which are in the printer's hands.  I look to get yours 
soon.  I am sorry to hear that the Custom House has proved 
fallible, like all other human houses and customs.  Life consists 
of that sort of business, and I fear that there is a class of man, 
of which you offer no inapt type, doomed to a kind of mild, general 
disappointment through life.  I do not believe that a man is the 
more unhappy for that.  Disappointment, except with one's self, is 
not a very capital affair; and the sham beatitude, 'Blessed is he 
that expecteth little,' one of the truest, and in a sense, the most 
Christlike things in literature.
</p><p>Alongside of you, I have been all my days a red cannon ball of 
dissipated effort; here I am by the heels in this Alpine valley, 
with just so much of a prospect of future restoration as shall make 
my present caged estate easily tolerable to me - shall or should, I 
would not swear to the word before the trial's done.  I miss all my 
objects in the meantime; and, thank God, I have enough of my old, 
and maybe somewhat base philosophy, to keep me on a good 
understanding with myself and Providence.
</p><p>The mere extent of a man's travels has in it something consolatory.  
That he should have left friends and enemies in many different and 
distant quarters gives a sort of earthly dignity to his existence.  
And I think the better of myself for the belief that I have left 
some in California interested in me and my successes.  Let me 
assure you, you who have made friends already among such various 
and distant races, that there is a certain phthisical Scot who will 
always be pleased to hear good news of you, and would be better 
pleased by nothing than to learn that you had thrown off your 
present incubus, largely consisting of letters I believe, and had 
sailed into some square work by way of change.
</p><p>And by way of change in itself, let me copy on the other pages some 
broad Scotch I wrote for you when I was ill last spring in Oakland.  
It is no muckle worth:  but ye should na look a gien horse in the 
moo'. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>DECEMBER 21, 1880.  DAVOS.
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - I do not understand these reproaches.  The 
letters come between seven and nine in the evening; and every one 
about the books was answered that same night, and the answer left 
Davos by seven o'clock next morning.  Perhaps the snow delayed 
then; if so, 'tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent 
silences.  There is no hurry about my father's notes; I shall not 
be writing anything till I get home again, I believe.  Only I want 
to be able to keep reading AD HOC all winter, as it seems about all 
I shall be fit for.  About John Brown, I have been breaking my 
heart to finish a Scotch poem to him.  Some of it is not really 
bad, but the rest will not come, and I mean to get it right before 
I do anything else.
</p><p>The bazaar is over, 160 pounds gained, and everybody's health lost:  
altogether, I never had a more uncomfortable time; apply to Fanny 
for further details of the discomfort.
</p><p>We have our Wogg in somewhat better trim now, and vastly better 
spirits.  The weather has been bad - for Davos, but indeed it is a 
wonderful climate.  It never feels cold; yesterday, with a little, 
chill, small, northerly draught, for the first time, it was 
pinching.  Usually, it may freeze, or snow, or do what it pleases, 
you feel it not, or hardly any.
</p><p>Thanks for your notes; that fishery question will come in, as you 
notice, in the Highland Book, as well as under the Union; it is 
very important.  I hear no word of Hugh Miller's EVICTIONS; I count 
on that.  What you say about the old and new Statistical is odd.  
It seems to me very much as if I were gingerly embarking on a 
HISTORY OF MODERN SCOTLAND.  Probably Tulloch will never carry it 
out.  And, you see, once I have studied and written these two 
vols., THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS and SCOTLAND 
AND THE UNION, I shall have a good ground to go upon.  The effect 
on my mind of what I have read has been to awaken a livelier 
sympathy for the Irish; although they never had the remarkable 
virtues, I fear they have suffered many of the injustices, of the 
Scottish Highlanders.  Ruedi has seen me this morning; he says the 
disease is at a standstill, and I am to profit by it to take more 
exercise.  Altogether, he seemed quite hopeful and pleased. - I am 
your ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L S.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, Christmas 1880.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Thanks for yours; I waited, as said I would.  I 
now expect no answer from you, regarding you as a mere dumb cock-
shy, or a target, at which we fire our arrows diligently all day 
long, with no anticipation it will bring them back to us.  We are 
both sadly mortified you are not coming, but health comes first; 
alas, that man should be so crazy.  What fun we could have, if we 
were all well, what work we could do, what a happy place we could 
make it for each other!  If I were able to do what I want; but then 
I am not, and may leave that vein.
</p><p>No.  I do not think I shall require to know the Gaelic; few things 
are written in that language, or ever were; if you come to that, 
the number of those who could write, or even read it, through 
almost all my period, must, by all accounts, have been incredibly 
small.  Of course, until the book is done, I must live as much as 
possible in the Highlands, and that suits my book as to health.  It 
is a most interesting and sad story, and from the '45 it is all to 
be written for the first time.  This, of course, will cause me a 
far greater difficulty about authorities; but I have already 
learned much, and where to look for more.  One pleasant feature is 
the vast number of delightful writers I shall have to deal with:  
Burt, Johnson, Boswell, Mrs. Grant of Laggan, Scott.  There will be 
interesting sections on the Ossianic controversy and the growth of 
the taste for Highland scenery.  I have to touch upon Rob Roy, 
Flora Macdonald, the strange story of Lady Grange, the beautiful 
story of the tenants on the Forfeited Estates, and the odd, inhuman 
problem of the great evictions.  The religious conditions are wild, 
unknown, very surprising.  And three out of my five parts remain 
hitherto entirely unwritten.  Smack! - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHRISTMAS SERMON.
[HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, DECEMBER 26, 1880.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - I was very tired yesterday and could not write; 
tobogganed so furiously all morning; we had a delightful day, 
crowned by an incredible dinner - more courses than I have fingers 
on my hands.  Your letter arrived duly at night, and I thank you 
for it as I should.  You need not suppose I am at all insensible to 
my father's extraordinary kindness about this book; he is a brick; 
I vote for him freely.
</p><p>. . . The assurance you speak of is what we all ought to have, and 
might have, and should not consent to live without.  That people do 
not have it more than they do is, I believe, because persons speak 
so much in large-drawn, theological similitudes, and won't say out 
what they mean about life, and man, and God, in fair and square 
human language.  I wonder if you or my father ever thought of the 
obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in 
which the Ten Commandments are stated, or of how Christ was so 
continually substituting affirmations.  'Thou shalt not' is but an 
example; 'Thou shalt' is the law of God.  It was this that seems 
meant in the phrase that 'not one jot nor tittle of the law should 
pass.'  But what led me to the remark is this:  A kind of black, 
angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives.  'To 
love one's neighbour as oneself' is certainly much harder, but 
states life so much more actively, gladly, and kindly, that you 
begin to see some pleasure in it; and till you can see pleasure in 
these hard choices and bitter necessities, where is there any Good 
News to men?  It is much more important to do right than not to do 
wrong; further, the one is possible, the other has always been and 
will ever be impossible; and the faithful DESIGN TO DO RIGHT is 
accepted by God; that seems to me to be the Gospel, and that was 
how Christ delivered us from the Law.  After people are told that, 
surely they might hear more encouraging sermons.  To blow the 
trumpet for good would seem the Parson's business; and since it is 
not in our own strength, but by faith and perseverance (no account 
made of slips), that we are to run the race, I do not see where 
they get the material for their gloomy discourses.  Faith is not to 
believe the Bible, but to believe in God; if you believe in God 
(or, for it's the same thing, have that assurance you speak about), 
where is there any more room for terror?  There are only three 
possible attitudes - Optimism, which has gone to smash; Pessimism, 
which is on the rising hand, and very popular with many clergymen 
who seem to think they are Christians.  And this Faith, which is 
the Gospel.  Once you hold the last, it is your business (1) to 
find out what is right in any given case, and (2) to try to do it; 
if you fail in the last, that is by commission, Christ tells you to 
hope; if you fail in the first, that is by omission, his picture of 
the last day gives you but a black lookout.  The whole necessary 
morality is kindness; and it should spring, of itself, from the one 
fundamental doctrine, Faith.  If you are sure that God, in the long 
run, means kindness by you, you should be happy; and if happy, 
surely you should be kind.
</p><p>I beg your pardon for this long discourse; it is not all right, of 
course, but I am sure there is something in it.  One thing I have 
not got clearly; that about the omission and the commission; but 
there is truth somewhere about it, and I have no time to clear it 
just now.  Do you know, you have had about a Cornhill page of 
sermon?  It is, however, true.
</p><p>Lloyd heard with dismay Fanny was not going to give me a present; 
so F. and I had to go and buy things for ourselves, and go through 
a representation of surprise when they were presented next morning.  
It gave us both quite a Santa Claus feeling on Xmas Eve to see him 
so excited and hopeful; I enjoyed it hugely. - Your affectionate 
son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, SPRING 1881.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN. - My health is not just what it should be; I have 
lost weight, pulse, respiration, etc., and gained nothing in the 
way of my old bellows.  But these last few days, with tonic, cod-
liver oil, better wine (there is some better now), and perpetual 
beef-tea, I think I have progressed.  To say truth, I have been 
here a little over long.  I was reckoning up, and since I have 
known you, already quite a while, I have not, I believe, remained 
so long in any one place as here in Davos.  That tells on my old 
gipsy nature; like a violin hung up, I begin to lose what music 
there was in me; and with the music, I do not know what besides, or 
do not know what to call it, but something radically part of life, 
a rhythm, perhaps, in one's old and so brutally over-ridden nerves, 
or perhaps a kind of variety of blood that the heart has come to 
look for.
</p><p>I purposely knocked myself off first.  As to F. A. S., I believe I 
am no sound authority; I alternate between a stiff disregard and a 
kind of horror.  In neither mood can a man judge at all.  I know 
the thing to be terribly perilous, I fear it to be now altogether 
hopeless.  Luck has failed; the weather has not been favourable; 
and in her true heart, the mother hopes no more.  But - well, I 
feel a great deal, that I either cannot or will not say, as you 
well know.  It has helped to make me more conscious of the 
wolverine on my own shoulders, and that also makes me a poor judge 
and poor adviser.  Perhaps, if we were all marched out in a row, 
and a piece of platoon firing to the drums performed, it would be 
well for us; although, I suppose - and yet I wonder! - so ill for 
the poor mother and for the dear wife.  But you can see this makes 
me morbid.  SUFFICIT; EXPLICIT.
</p><p>You are right about the Carlyle book; F. and I are in a world not 
ours; but pardon me, as far as sending on goes, we take another 
view:  the first volume, A LA BONNE HEURE! but not - never - the 
second.  Two hours of hysterics can be no good matter for a sick 
nurse, and the strange, hard, old being in so lamentable and yet 
human a desolation - crying out like a burnt child, and yet always 
wisely and beautifully - how can that end, as a piece of reading, 
even to the strong - but on the brink of the most cruel kind of 
weeping?  I observe the old man's style is stronger on me than ever 
it was, and by rights, too, since I have just laid down his most 
attaching book.  God rest the baith o' them!  But even if they do 
not meet again, how we should all be strengthened to be kind, and 
not only in act, in speech also, that so much more important part.  
See what this apostle of silence most regrets, not speaking out his 
heart.
</p><p>I was struck as you were by the admirable, sudden, clear sunshine 
upon Southey - even on his works.  Symonds, to whom I repeated it, 
remarked at once, a man who was thus respected by both Carlyle and 
Landor must have had more in him than we can trace.  So I feel with 
true humility.
</p><p>It was to save my brain that Symonds proposed reviewing.  He and, 
it appears, Leslie Stephen fear a little some eclipse; I am not 
quite without sharing the fear.  I know my own languor as no one 
else does; it is a dead down-draught, a heavy fardel.  Yet if I 
could shake off the wolverine aforesaid, and his fangs are lighter, 
though perhaps I feel them more, I believe I could be myself again 
a while.  I have not written any letter for a great time; none 
saying what I feel, since you were here, I fancy.  Be duly obliged 
for it, and take my most earnest thanks not only for the books but 
for your letter.  Your affectionate,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>The effect of reading this on Fanny shows me I must tell you I am 
very happy, peaceful, and jolly, except for questions of work and 
the states of other people.
</p><p>Woggin sends his love.

<p>Letter:  TO HORATIO F. BROWN

</p><p>DAVOS, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR BROWN. - Here it is, with the mark of a San Francisco 
BOUQUINISTE.  And if ever in all my 'human conduct' I have done a 
better thing to any fellow-creature than handing on to you this 
sweet, dignified, and wholesome book, I know I shall hear of it on 
the last day.  To write a book like this were impossible; at least 
one can hand it on - with a wrench - one to another.  My wife cries 
out and my own heart misgives me, but still here it is.  I could 
scarcely better prove myself - Yours affectionately,

<p>Letter:  TO HORATIO F. BROWN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>DAVOS, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR BROWN. - I hope, if you get thus far, you will know what an 
invaluable present I have made you.  Even the copy was dear to me, 
printed in the colony that Penn established, and carried in my 
pocket all about the San Francisco streets, read in street cars and 
ferry-boats, when I was sick unto death, and found in all times and 
places a peaceful and sweet companion.  But I hope, when you shall 
have reached this note, my gift will not have been in vain; for 
while just now we are so busy and intelligent, there is not the man 
living, no, nor recently dead, that could put, with so lovely a 
spirit, so much honest, kind wisdom into words.

<p>Letter:  TO HORATIO F. BROWN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, SPRING 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR BROWN, - Nine years I have conded them.
</p><p>Brave lads in olden musical centuries
Sang, night by night, adorable choruses,
Sat late by alehouse doors in April
Chaunting in joy as the moon was rising:
</p><p>Moon-seen and merry, under the trellises,
Flush-faced they played with old polysyllables;
Spring scents inspired, old wine diluted;
Love and Apollo were there to chorus.
</p><p>Now these, the songs, remain to eternity,
Those, only those, the bountiful choristers
Gone - those are gone, those unremembered
Sleep and are silent in earth for ever.
</p><p>So man himself appears and evanishes,
So smiles and goes; as wanderers halting at
Some green-embowered house, play their music,
Play and are gone on the windy highway;
</p><p>Yet dwells the strain enshrined in the memory
Long after they departed eternally,
Forth-faring tow'rd far mountain summits,
Cities of men on the sounding Ocean.
</p><p>Youth sang the song in years immemorial;
Brave chanticleer, he sang and was beautiful;
Bird-haunted, green tree-tops in springtime
Heard and were pleased by the voice of singing;
</p><p>Youth goes, and leaves behind him a prodigy -
Songs sent by thee afar from Venetian
Sea-grey lagunes, sea-paven highways,
Dear to me here in my Alpine exile.
</p><p>Please, my dear Brown, forgive my horrid delay.  Symonds overworked 
and knocked up.  I off my sleep; my wife gone to Paris.  Weather 
lovely. - Yours ever,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>Monte Generoso in May; here, I think, till the end of April; write 
again, to prove you are forgiving.

<p>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL DU PAVILLON HENRY IV., ST. GERMAIN-EN-LAYE, SUNDAY, MAY 1ST, 
1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - A week in Paris reduced me to the limpness and 
lack of appetite peculiar to a kid glove, and gave Fanny a jumping 
sore throat.  It's my belief there is death in the kettle there; a 
pestilence or the like.  We came out here, pitched on the STAR and 
GARTER (they call it Somebody's pavilion), found the place a bed of 
lilacs and nightingales (first time I ever heard one), and also of 
a bird called the PIASSEUR, cheerfulest of sylvan creatures, an 
ideal comic opera in itself.  'Come along, what fun, here's Pan in 
the next glade at picnic, and this-yer's Arcadia, and it's awful 
fun, and I've had a glass, I will not deny, but not to see it on 
me,' that is his meaning as near as I can gather.  Well, the place 
(forest of beeches all new-fledged, grass like velvet, fleets of 
hyacinth) pleased us and did us good.  We tried all ways to find a 
cheaper place, but could find nothing safe; cold, damp, brick-
floored rooms and sich; we could not leave Paris till your seven 
days' sight on draft expired; we dared not go back to be 
miasmatised in these homes of putridity; so here we are till 
Tuesday in the STAR AND GARTER.  My throat is quite cured, appetite 
and strength on the mend.  Fanny seems also picking up.
</p><p>If we are to come to Scotland, I WILL have fir-trees, and I want a 
burn, the firs for my physical, the water for my moral health. - 
Ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>PITLOCHRY, PERTHSHIRE, JUNE 6, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - Here I am in my native land, being gently blown and 
hailed upon, and sitting nearer and nearer to the fire.  A cottage 
near a moor is soon to receive our human forms; it is also near a 
burn to which Professor Blackie (no less!) has written some verses 
in his hot old age, and near a farm from whence we shall draw cream 
and fatness.  Should I be moved to join Blackie, I shall go upon my 
knees and pray hard against temptation; although, since the new 
Version, I do not know the proper form of words.  The swollen, 
childish, and pedantic vanity that moved the said revisers to put 
'bring'  for 'lead,' is a sort of literary fault that calls for an 
eternal hell; it may be quite a small place, a star of the least 
magnitude, and shabbily furnished; there shall -, -, the revisers 
of the Bible and other absolutely loathsome literary lepers, dwell 
among broken pens, bad, GROUNDY ink and ruled blotting-paper made 
in France - all eagerly burning to write, and all inflicted with 
incurable aphasia.  I should not have thought upon that torture had 
I not suffered it in moderation myself, but it is too horrid even 
for a hell; let's let 'em off with an eternal toothache.
</p><p>All this talk is partly to persuade you that I write to you out of 
good feeling only, which is not the case.  I am a beggar:  ask 
Dobson, Saintsbury, yourself, and any other of these cheeses who 
know something of the eighteenth century, what became of Jean 
Cavalier between his coming to England and his death in 1740.  Is 
anything interesting known about him?  Whom did he marry?  The 
happy French, smilingly following one another in a long procession 
headed by the loud and empty Napoleon Peyrat, say, Olympe Dunoyer, 
Voltaire's old flame.  Vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals, 
and is very French and very literary and very silly in his 
comments.  Now I may almost say it consists with my knowledge that 
all this has not a shadow to rest upon.  It is very odd and very 
annoying; I have splendid materials for Cavalier till he comes to 
my own country; and there, though he continues to advance in the 
service, he becomes entirely invisible to me.  Any information 
about him will be greatly welcome:  I may mention that I know as 
much as I desire about the other prophets, Marion, Fage, Cavalier 
(de Sonne), my Cavalier's cousin, the unhappy Lions, and the 
idiotic Mr. Lacy; so if any erudite starts upon that track, you may 
choke him off.  If you can find aught for me, or if you will but 
try, count on my undying gratitude.  Lang's 'Library' is very 
pleasant reading.
</p><p>My book will reach you soon, for I write about it to-day - Yours 
ever,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, PERTHSHIRE, JUNE 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - THE BLACK MAN AND OTHER TALES.
</p><p>The Black Man:
</p><p>I. Thrawn Janet.
II. The Devil on Cramond Sands.
The Shadow on the Bed.
The Body Snatchers.
The Case Bottle.
The King's Horn.
The Actor's Wife.
The Wreck of the SUSANNA.
</p><p>This is the new work on which I am engaged with Fanny; they are all 
supernatural.  'Thrawn Janet' is off to Stephen, but as it is all 
in Scotch he cannot take it, I know.  It was SO GOOD, I could not 
help sending it.  My health improves.  We have a lovely spot here:  
a little green glen with a burn, a wonderful burn, gold and green 
and snow-white, singing loud and low in different steps of its 
career, now pouring over miniature crags, now fretting itself to 
death in a maze of rocky stairs and pots; never was so sweet a 
little river.  Behind, great purple moorlands reaching to Ben 
Vrackie.  Hunger lives here, alone with larks and sheep.  Sweet 
spot, sweet spot.
</p><p>Write me a word about Bob's professoriate and Landor, and what you 
think of THE BLACK MAN.  The tales are all ghastly.  'Thrawn Janet' 
frightened me to death.  There will maybe be another - 'The Dead 
Man's A Letter.'  I believe I shall recover; and I am, in this 
blessed hope, yours exuberantly,

<p>Letter:  TO PROFESSOR AENEAS MACKAY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 21, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR MACKAY, - What is this I hear? - that you are retiring from 
your chair.  It is not, I hope, from ill-health?
</p><p>But if you are retiring, may I ask if you have promised your 
support to any successor?  I have a great mind to try.  The summer 
session would suit me; the chair would suit me - if only I would 
suit it; I certainly should work it hard:  that I can promise.  I 
only wish it were a few years from now, when I hope to have 
something more substantial to show for myself.  Up to the present 
time, all that I have published, even bordering on history, has 
been in an occasional form, and I fear this is much against me.
</p><p>Please let me hear a word in answer, and believe me, yours very 
sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO PROFESSOR AENEAS MACKAY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, PERTHSHIRE [JUNE 1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR MACKAY, - Thank you very much for your kind letter, and 
still more for your good opinion.  You are not the only one who has 
regretted my absence from your lectures; but you were to me, then, 
only a part of a mangle through which I was being slowly and 
unwillingly dragged - part of a course which I had not chosen - 
part, in a word, of an organised boredom.
</p><p>I am glad to have your reasons for giving up the chair; they are 
partly pleasant, and partly honourable to you.  And I think one may 
say that every man who publicly declines a plurality of offices, 
makes it perceptibly more difficult for the next man to accept 
them.
</p><p>Every one tells me that I come too late upon the field, every one 
being pledged, which, seeing it is yet too early for any one to 
come upon the field, I must regard as a polite evasion.  Yet all 
advise me to stand, as it might serve me against the next vacancy.  
So stand I shall, unless things are changed.  As it is, with my 
health this summer class is a great attraction; it is perhaps the 
only hope I may have of a permanent income.  I had supposed the 
needs of the chair might be met by choosing every year some period 
of history in which questions of Constitutional Law were involved; 
but this is to look too far forward.
</p><p>I understand (1ST) that no overt steps can be taken till your 
resignation is accepted; and (2ND) that in the meantime I may, 
without offence, mention my design to stand.
</p><p>If I am mistaken about these, please correct me, as I do not wish 
to appear where I should not.
</p><p>Again thanking you very heartily for your coals of fire I remain 
yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, JUNE 24, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I wonder if I misdirected my last to you.  I begin 
to fear it.  I hope, however, this will go right.  I am in act to 
do a mad thing - to stand for the Edinburgh Chair of History; it is 
elected for by the advocates, QUORUM PARS; I am told that I am too 
late this year; but advised on all hands to go on, as it is likely 
soon to be once more vacant; and I shall have done myself good for 
the next time.  Now, if I got the thing (which I cannot, it 
appears), I believe, in spite of all my imperfections, I could be 
decently effectual.  If you can think so also, do put it in a 
testimonial.
</p><p>Heavens!  JE ME SAUVE, I have something else to say to you, but 
after that (which is not a joke) I shall keep it for another shoot. 
- Yours testimonially,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I surely need not add, dear lad, that if you don't feel like it, 
you will only have to pacify me by a long letter on general 
subjects, when I shall hasten to respond in recompense for my 
assault upon the postal highway.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY [JULY 1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - Many thanks for the testimonial; many thanks for 
your blind, wondering letter; many wishes, lastly, for your swift 
recovery.  Insomnia is the opposite pole from my complaint; which 
brings with it a nervous lethargy, an unkind, unwholesome, and 
ungentle somnolence, fruitful in heavy heads and heavy eyes at 
morning.  You cannot sleep; well, I can best explain my state thus:  
I cannot wake.  Sleep, like the lees of a posset, lingers all day, 
lead-heavy, in my knees and ankles.  Weight on the shoulders, 
torpor on the brain.  And there is more than too much of that from 
an ungrateful hound who is now enjoying his first decently 
competent and peaceful weeks for close upon two years; happy in a 
big brown moor behind him, and an incomparable burn by his side; 
happy, above all, in some work - for at last I am at work with that 
appetite and confidence that alone makes work supportable.
</p><p>I told you I had something else to say.  I am very tedious - it is 
another request.  In August and a good part of September we shall 
be in Braemar, in a house with some accommodation.  Now Braemar is 
a place patronised by the royalty of the Sister Kingdoms - Victoria 
and the Cairngorms, sir, honouring that countryside by their 
conjunct presence.  This seems to me the spot for A Bard.  Now can 
you come to see us for a little while?  I can promise you, you must 
like my father, because you are a human being; you ought to like 
Braemar, because of your avocation; and you ought to like me, 
because I like you; and again, you must like my wife, because she 
likes cats; and as for my mother - well, come and see, what do you 
think? that is best.  Mrs. Gosse, my wife tells me, will have other 
fish to fry; and to be plain, I should not like to ask her till I 
had seen the house.  But a lone man I know we shall be equal to.  
QU'EN DIS TU?  VIENS. - Yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO P. G. HAMERTON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY [JULY 1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR MR. HAMMERTON, - (There goes the second M.; it is a 
certainty.)  Thank you for your prompt and kind answer, little as I 
deserved it, though I hope to show you I was less undeserving than 
I seemed.  But just might I delete two words in your testimonial?  
The two words 'and legal' were unfortunately winged by chance 
against my weakest spot, and would go far to damn me.
</p><p>It was not my bliss that I was interested in when I was married; it 
was a sort of marriage IN EXTREMIS; and if I am where I am, it is 
thanks to the care of that lady who married me when I was a mere 
complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of 
mortality than a bridegroom.
</p><p>I had a fair experience of that kind of illness when all the women 
(God bless them!) turn round upon the streets and look after you 
with a look that is only too kind not to be cruel.  I have had 
nearly two years of more or less prostration.  I have done no work 
whatever since the February before last until quite of late.  To be 
precise, until the beginning of last month, exactly two essays.  
All last winter I was at Davos; and indeed I am home here just now 
against the doctor's orders, and must soon be back again to that 
unkindly haunt 'upon the mountains visitant' - there goes no angel 
there but the angel of death.  The deaths of last winter are still 
sore spots to me. . . . So, you see, I am not very likely to go on 
a 'wild expedition,' cis-Stygian at least.  The truth is, I am 
scarce justified in standing for the chair, though I hope you will 
not mention this; and yet my health is one of my reasons, for the 
class is in summer.
</p><p>I hope this statement of my case will make my long neglect appear 
less unkind.  It was certainly not because I ever forgot you, or 
your unwonted kindness; and it was not because I was in any sense 
rioting in pleasures.
</p><p>I am glad to hear the catamaran is on her legs again; you have my 
warmest wishes for a good cruise down the Saone; and yet there 
comes some envy to that wish, for when shall I go cruising?  Here a 
sheer hulk, alas! lies R. L. S.  But I will continue to hope for a 
better time, canoes that will sail better to the wind, and a river 
grander than the Saone.
</p><p>I heard, by the way, in a letter of counsel from a well-wisher, one 
reason of my town's absurdity about the chair of Art:  I fear it is 
characteristic of her manners.  It was because you did not call 
upon the electors!
</p><p>Will you remember me to Mrs. Hamerton and your son? - And believe 
me, etc., etc.,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, [JULY 1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I do believe I am better, mind and body; I am 
tired just now, for I have just been up the burn with Wogg, daily 
growing better and boo'f'ler; so do not judge my state by my style 
in this.  I am working steady, four Cornhill pages scrolled every 
day, besides the correspondence about this chair, which is heavy in 
itself.  My first story, 'Thrawn Janet,' all in Scotch, is accepted 
by Stephen; my second, 'The Body Snatchers,' is laid aside in a 
justifiable disgust, the tale being horrid; my third, 'The Merry 
Men,' I am more than half through, and think real well of.  It is a 
fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks; and I like it much above 
all my other attempts at story-telling; I think it is strange; if 
ever I shall make a hit, I have the line now, as I believe.
</p><p>Fanny has finished one of hers, 'The Shadow on the Bed,' and is now 
hammering at a second, for which we have 'no name' as yet - not by 
Wilkie Collins.
</p><p>TALES FOR WINTER NIGHTS.  Yes, that, I think, we will call the lot

</p><p>Why have you not sent me a testimonial?  Everybody else but you has 
responded, and Symonds, but I'm afraid he's ill.  Do think, too, if 
anybody else would write me a testimonial.  I am told quantity goes 
far.  I have good ones from Rev. Professor Campbell, Professor 
Meiklejohn, Leslie Stephen, Lang, Gosse, and a very shaky one from 
Hamerton.
</p><p>Grant is an elector, so can't, but has written me kindly.  From

go back to that place, it seems cruel.  I have not yet received the

</p><p>Yours came; the class is in summer; many thanks for the 
testimonial, it is bully; arrived along with it another from 
Symonds, also bully; he is ill, but not lungs, thank God - fever

aristo.'s of the valley.  There is no hope for me, but if there 
were, you would hear sweetness and light streaming from my lips.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, JULY 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - I hope, then, to have a visit from you.  If 
before August, here; if later, at Braemar.  Tupe!
</p><p>And now, MON BON, I must babble about 'The Merry Men,' my favourite 
work.  It is a fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks.  Chapter 
I. 'Eilean Aros' - the island, the roost, the 'merry men,' the 
three people there living - sea superstitions.  Chapter II. 'What 
the Wreck had brought to Aros.'  Eh, boy? what had it?  Silver and 
clocks and brocades, and what a conscience, what a mad brain!  
Chapter III. 'Past and Present in Sandag Bay' - the new wreck and 
the old - so old - the Armada treasure-ship, Santma Trinid - the 
grave in the heather - strangers there.  Chapter IV. 'The Gale' - 
the doomed ship - the storm - the drunken madman on the head - 
cries in the night.  Chapter V. 'A Man out of the Sea.'  But I must 
not breathe to you my plot.  It is, I fancy, my first real shoot at 
a story; an odd thing, sir, but, I believe, my own, though there is 
a little of Scott's PIRATE in it, as how should there not?  He had 
the root of romance in such places.  Aros is Earraid, where I lived 
lang syne; the Ross of Grisapol is the Ross of Mull; Ben Ryan, Ben 
More.  I have written to the middle of Chapter IV.  Like enough, 
when it is finished I shall discard all chapterings; for the thing 
is written straight through.  It must, unhappily, be re-written - 
too well written not to be.
</p><p>The chair is only three months in summer; that is why I try for it.  
If I get it, which I shall not, I should be independent at once.  
Sweet thought.  I liked your Byron well; your Berlioz better.  No 
one would remark these cuts; even I, who was looking for it, knew 
it not at all to be a TORSO.  The paper strengthens me in my 
recommendation to you to follow Colvin's hint.  Give us an 1830; 
you will do it well, and the subject smiles widely on the world:-
</p><p>1830:  A CHAPTER OF ARTISTIC HISTORY, by William Ernest Henley (or 
OF SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC HISTORY, as the thing might grow to you).  
Sir, you might be in the Athenaeum yet with that; and, believe me, 
you might and would be far better, the author of a readable book. - 
Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>The following names have been invented for Wogg by his dear papa:-
</p><p>Grunty-pig (when he is scratched),
Rose-mouth (when he comes flying up with his rose-leaf tongue 
depending), and
Hoofen-boots (when he has had his foots wet).

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>PITLOCHRY, IF YOU PLEASE, [AUGUST] 1881.
</p><p>DEAR HENLEY, - To answer a point or two.  First, the Spanish ship 
was sloop-rigged and clumsy, because she was fitted out by some 
private adventurers, not over wealthy, and glad to take what they 
could get.  Is that not right?  Tell me if you think not.  That, at 
least, was how I meant it.  As for the boat-cloaks, I am afraid 
they are, as you say, false imagination; but I love the name, 
nature, and being of them so dearly, that I feel as if I would 
almost rather ruin a story than omit the reference.  The proudest 
moments of my life have been passed in the stern-sheets of a boat 
with that romantic garment over my shoulders.  This, without 
prejudice to one glorious day when standing upon some water stairs 
at Lerwick I signalled with my pocket-handkerchief for a boat to 
come ashore for me.  I was then aged fifteen or sixteen; conceive 
my glory.
</p><p>Several of the phrases you object to are proper nautical, or long-
shore phrases, and therefore, I think, not out of place in this 
long-shore story.  As for the two members which you thought at 
first so ill-united; I confess they seem perfectly so to me.  I 
have chosen to sacrifice a long-projected story of adventure 
because the sentiment of that is identical with the sentiment of 
'My uncle.'  My uncle himself is not the story as I see it, only 
the leading episode of that story.  It's really a story of wrecks, 
as they appear to the dweller on the coast.  It's a view of the 
sea.  Goodness knows when I shall be able to re-write; I must first 
get over this copper-headed cold.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN
</p><p><br />
</p><p>PITLOCHRY, AUGUST 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - This is the first letter I have written this good 
while.  I have had a brutal cold, not perhaps very wisely treated; 
lots of blood - for me, I mean.  I was so well, however, before, 
that I seem to be sailing through with it splendidly.  My appetite 
never failed; indeed, as I got worse, it sharpened - a sort of 
reparatory instinct.  Now I feel in a fair way to get round soon.
</p><p>MONDAY, AUGUST (2ND, is it?). - We set out for the Spital of 
Glenshee, and reach Braemar on Tuesday.  The Braemar address we 
cannot learn; it looks as if 'Braemar' were all that was necessary; 
if particular, you can address 17 Heriot Row.  We shall be 
delighted to see you whenever, and as soon as ever, you can make it 
possible.
</p><p>. . . I hope heartily you will survive me, and do not doubt it.  
There are seven or eight people it is no part of my scheme in life 
to survive - yet if I could but heal me of my bellowses, I could 
have a jolly life - have it, even now, when I can work and stroll a 
little, as I have been doing till this cold.  I have so many things 
to make life sweet to me, it seems a pity I cannot have that other 
one thing - health.  But though you will be angry to hear it, I 
believe, for myself at least, what is is best.  I believed it all 
through my worst days, and I am not ashamed to profess it now.
</p><p>Landor has just turned up; but I had read him already.  I like him 
extremely; I wonder if the 'cuts' were perhaps not advantageous.  
It seems quite full enough; but then you know I am a 
compressionist.
</p><p>If I am to criticise, it is a little staid; but the classical is 
apt to look so.  It is in curious contrast to that inexpressive, 
unplanned wilderness of Forster's; clear, readable, precise, and 
sufficiently human.  I see nothing lost in it, though I could have 
wished, in my Scotch capacity, a trifle clearer and fuller 
exposition of his moral attitude, which is not quite clear 'from 
here.'
</p><p>He and his tyrannicide!  I am in a mad fury about these explosions.  
If that is the new world!  Damn O'Donovan Rossa; damn him behind 
and before, above, below, and roundabout; damn, deracinate, and 
destroy him, root and branch, self and company, world without end.  
Amen.  I write that for sport if you like, but I will pray in 
earnest, O Lord, if you cannot convert, kindly delete him!
</p><p>Stories naturally at - halt.  Henley has seen one and approves.  I 
believe it to be good myself, even real good.  He has also seen and 
approved one of Fanny's.  It will snake a good volume.  We have now
</p><p>Thrawn Janet (with Stephen), proof to-day.

<p>Letter:  TO DR. ALEXANDER JAPP
</p><p><br />
</p><p>THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR, SUNDAY, AUGUST 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR SIR, - I should long ago have written to thank you for your 
kind and frank letter; but in my state of health papers are apt to 
get mislaid, and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this 
(Sunday) morning.
</p><p>I regret I shall not be able to see you in Edinburgh; one visit to 
Edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that invaluable 
particular health; but if it should be at all possible for you to 
push on as far as Braemar, I believe you would find an attentive 
listener, and I can offer you a bed, a drive, and necessary food, 
etc.
</p><p>If, however, you should not be able to come thus far, I can promise 
you two things:  First, I shall religiously revise what I have 
written, and bring out more clearly the point of view from which I 
regarded Thoreau; second, I shall in the Preface record your 
objection.
</p><p>The point of view (and I must ask you not to forget that any such 
short paper is essentially only a SECTION THROUGH a man) was this:  
I desired to look at the man through his books.  Thus, for 
instance, when I mentioned his return to the pencil-making, I did 
it only in passing (perhaps I was wrong), because it seemed to me 
not an illustration of his principles, but a brave departure from 
them.  Thousands of such there were I do not doubt; still, they 
might be hardly to my purpose, though, as you say so, some of them 
would be.
</p><p>Our difference as to pity I suspect was a logomachy of my making.  
No pitiful acts on his part would surprise me; I know he would be 
more pitiful in practice than most of the whiners; but the spirit 
of that practice would still seem to be unjustly described by the 
word pity.
</p><p>When I try to be measured, I find myself usually suspected of a 
sneaking unkindness for my subject; but you may be sure, sir, I 
would give up most other things to be so good a man as Thoreau.  
Even my knowledge of him leads me thus far.
</p><p>Should you find yourself able to push on to Braemar - it may even 
be on your way - believe me, your visit will be most welcome.  The 
weather is cruel, but the place is, as I dare say you know, the 
very 'wale' of Scotland - bar Tummelside. - Yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL
</p><p><br />
</p><p>THE COTTAGE, CASTLETON OF BRAEMAR, AUGUST 1881.
</p><p>... WELL, I have been pretty mean, but I have not yet got over my 
cold so completely as to have recovered much energy.  It is really 
extraordinary that I should have recovered as well as I have in 
this blighting weather; the wind pipes, the rain comes in squalls, 
great black clouds are continually overhead, and it is as cold as 
March.  The country is delightful, more cannot be said; it is very 
beautiful, a perfect joy when we get a blink of sun to see it in.  
The Queen knows a thing or two, I perceive; she has picked out the 
finest habitable spot in Britain.
</p><p>I have done no work, and scarce written a letter for three weeks, 
but I think I should soon begin again; my cough is now very 
trifling.  I eat well, and seem to have lost but I little flesh in 
the meanwhile.  I was WONDERFULLY well before I caught this horrid 
cold.  I never thought I should have been as well again; I really 
enjoyed life and work; and, of course, I now have a good hope that 
this may return.
</p><p>I suppose you heard of our ghost stories.  They are somewhat 
delayed by my cold and a bad attack of laziness, embroidery, etc., 
under which Fanny had been some time prostrate.  It is horrid that 
we can get no better weather.  I did not get such good accounts of 
you as might have been.  You must imitate me.  I am now one of the 
most conscientious people at trying to get better you ever saw.  I 
have a white hat, it is much admired; also a plaid, and a heavy 
stoop; so I take my walks abroad, witching the world.
</p><p>Last night I was beaten at chess, and am still grinding under the 
blow. - Ever your faithful friend,

</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Come on the 24th, there is a dear fellow.  
Everybody else wants to come later, and it will be a godsend for,

</p><p>The rain rains and the winds do beat upon the cottage of the late

</p><p>It is to be trusted that the weather may improve ere you know the

</p><p>All will be glad to welcome you, not excepting, sir - Yours ever.
</p><p>You will now have gathered the lamentable intellectual collapse of, 
sir - Yours indeed.
</p><p>And nothing remains for me but to sign myself, sir - Yours,

</p><p>N.B. - Each of these clauses has to be read with extreme glibness, 
coming down whack upon the 'Sir.'  This is very important.  The 
fine stylistic inspiration will else be lost.
</p><p>I commit the man who made, the man who sold, and the woman who 
supplied me with my present excruciating gilt nib to that place 
where the worm never dies.
</p><p>The reference to a deceased Highland lady (tending as it does to 
foster unavailing sorrow) may be with advantage omitted from the

</p><p>[BRAEMAR], AUGUST 19, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - I have by an extraordinary drollery of Fortune sent 
off to you by this day's post a P. C. inviting you to appear in 
sealskin.  But this had reference to the weather, and not at all, 
as you may have been led to fancy, to our rustic raiment of an 
evening.
</p><p>As to that question, I would deal, in so far as in me lies, fairly 
with all men.  We are not dressy people by nature; but it sometimes 
occurs to us to entertain angels.  In the country, I believe, even 
angels may be decently welcomed in tweed; I have faced many great 
personages, for my own part, in a tasteful suit of sea-cloth with 
an end of carpet pending from my gullet.  Still, we do maybe twice 
a summer burst out in the direction of blacks . . . and yet we do 
it seldom. . . . In short, let your own heart decide, and the 
capacity of your portmanteau.  If you came in camel's hair, you 
would still, although conspicuous, be welcome.
</p><p>The sooner the better after Tuesday. - Yours ever,

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>BRAEMAR [AUGUST 25, 1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Of course I am a rogue.  Why, Lord, it's known, 
man; but you should remember I have had a horrid cold.  Now, I'm 
better, I think; and see here - nobody, not you, nor Lang, nor the 
devil, will hurry me with our crawlers.  They are coming.  Four of 
them are as good as done, and the rest will come when ripe; but I 
am now on another lay for the moment, purely owing to Lloyd, this 
one; but I believe there's more coin in it than in any amount of 
crawlers:  now, see here, 'The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island:  A 
Story for Boys.'
</p><p>If this don't fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my 
day.  Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, 
that it begins in the ADMIRAL BENBOW public-house on Devon coast, 
that it's all about a map, and a treasure, and a mutiny, and a 
derelict ship, and a current, and a fine old Squire Trelawney (the 
real Tre, purged of literature and sin, to suit the infant mind), 
and a doctor, and another doctor, and a sea-cook with one leg, and 
a sea-song with the chorus 'Yo-ho-ho-and a bottle of rum' (at the 
third Ho you heave at the capstan bars), which is a real 
buccaneer's song, only known to the crew of the late Captain Flint 
(died of rum at Key West, much regretted, friends will please 
accept this intimation); and lastly, would you be surprised to 
hear, in this connection, the name of ROUTLEDGE?  That's the kind 
of man I am, blast your eyes.  Two chapters are written, and have 
been tried on Lloyd with great success; the trouble is to work it 
off without oaths.  Buccaneers without oaths - bricks without 
straw.  But youth and the fond parient have to be consulted.
</p><p>And now look here - this is next day - and three chapters are 
written and read.  (Chapter I. The Old Sea-dog at the ADMIRAL 
BENBOW.  Chapter II. Black Dog appears and disappears.  Chapter 
III. The Black Spot)  All now heard by Lloyd, F., and my father and 
mother, with high approval.  It's quite silly and horrid fun, and 
what I want is the BEST book about the Buccaneers that can be had - 
the latter B's above all, Blackbeard and sich, and get Nutt or Bain 
to send it skimming by the fastest post.  And now I know you'll 
write to me, for 'The Sea Cook's' sake.
</p><p>Your 'Admiral Guinea' is curiously near my line, but of course I'm 
fooling; and your Admiral sounds like a shublime gent.  Stick to 
him like wax - he'll do.  My Trelawney is, as I indicate, several 
thousand sea-miles off the lie of the original or your Admiral 
Guinea; and besides, I have no more about him yet but one mention 
of his name, and I think it likely he may turn yet farther from the 
model in the course of handling.  A chapter a day I mean to do; 
they are short; and perhaps in a month the 'Sea Cook' may to 
Routledge go, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!  My Trelawney has a 
strong dash of Landor, as I see him from here.  No women in the 
story, Lloyd's orders; and who so blithe to obey?  It's awful fun 
boys' stories; you just indulge the pleasure of your heart, that's 
all; no trouble, no strain.  The only stiff thing is to get it 
ended - that I don't see, but I look to a volcano.  O sweet, O 
generous, O human toils.  You would like my blind beggar in Chapter 
III. I believe; no writing, just drive along as the words come and 
the pen will scratch!

<p>Letter:  TO DR. ALEXANDER JAPP
</p><p><br />
</p><p>BRAEMAR, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. JAPP, - My father has gone, but I think may take it 
upon me to ask you to keep the book.  Of all things you could do to 
endear yourself to me, you have done the best, for my father and 
you have taken a fancy to each other.
</p><p>I do not know how to thank you for all your kind trouble in the 
matter of 'The Sea-Cook,' but I am not unmindful.  My health is 
still poorly, and I have added intercostal rheumatism - a new 
attraction - which sewed me up nearly double for two days, and 
still gives me a list to starboard - let us be ever nautical!
</p><p>I do not think with the start I have there will be any difficulty 
in letting Mr. Henderson go ahead whenever he likes.  I will write 
my story up to its legitimate conclusion; and then we shall be in a 
position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable, and I would 
then myself know better about its practicability from the story-
teller's point of view. - Yours ever very sincerely,

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>BRAEMAR, SEPTEMBER 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Thanks for your last.  The 100 pounds fell 
through, or dwindled at least into somewhere about 30 pounds.  
However, that I've taken as a mouthful, so you may look out for 
'The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island:  A Tale of the Buccaneers,' in 
YOUNG FOLKS.  (The terms are 2 pounds, 10s. a page of 4500 words; 
that's not noble, is it?  But I have my copyright safe.  I don't 
get illustrated - a blessing; that's the price I have to pay for my 
copyright.)
</p><p>I'll make this boys' book business pay; but I have to make a 
beginning.  When I'm done with YOUNG FOLKS, I'll try Routledge or 
some one.  I feel pretty sure the 'Sea Cook' will do to reprint, 
and bring something decent at that.
</p><p>Japp is a good soul.  The poet was very gay and pleasant.  He told 
me much:  he is simply the most active young man in England, and 
one of the most intelligent.  'He shall o'er Europe, shall o'er 
earth extend.' (13)  He is now extending over adjacent parts of 
Scotland.
</p><p>I propose to follow up the 'Sea Cook' at proper intervals by 'Jerry 
Abershaw:  A Tale of Putney Heath' (which or its site I must 
visit), 'The Leading Light:  A Tale of the Coast,' 'The Squaw Men:  
or the Wild West,' and other instructive and entertaining work.  
'Jerry Abershaw' should be good, eh?  I love writing boys' books.  
This first is only an experiment; wait till you see what I can make 
'em with my hand in.  I'll be the Harrison Ainsworth of the future; 
and a chalk better by St. Christopher; or at least as good.  You'll 
see that even by the 'Sea Cook.'
</p><p>Jerry Abershaw - O what a title!  Jerry Abershaw:  d-n it, sir, 
it's a poem.  The two most lovely words in English; and what a 
sentiment!  Hark you, how the hoofs ring!  Is this a blacksmith's?  
No, it's a wayside inn.  Jerry Abershaw.  'It was a clear, frosty 
evening, not 100 miles from Putney,' etc.  Jerry Abershaw.  Jerry 
Abershaw.  Jerry Abershaw.  The 'Sea Cook' is now in its sixteenth 
chapter, and bids for well up in the thirties.  Each three chapters 
is worth 2 pounds, 10s.  So we've 12 pounds, 10s. already.
</p><p>Don't read Marryat's' PIRATE anyhow; it is written in sand with a 
salt-spoon:  arid, feeble, vain, tottering production.  But then 
we're not always all there.  He was all somewhere else that trip.  
It's DAMNABLE, Henley.  I don't go much on the 'Sea Cook'; but, 
Lord, it's a little fruitier than the PIRATE by Cap'n. Marryat.
</p><p>Since this was written 'The Cook' is in his nineteenth chapter.  
Yo-heave ho!

<p>Letter:  TO P. G. HAMERTON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, AUTUMN [1881].
</p><p>MY DEAR MR. HAMERTON, - My conscience has long been smiting me, 
till it became nearly chronic.  My excuses, however, are many and 
not pleasant.  Almost immediately after I last wrote to you, I had 
a hemorreage (I can't spell it), was badly treated by a doctor in 
the country, and have been a long while picking up - still, in 
fact, have much to desire on that side.  Next, as soon as I got 
here, my wife took ill; she is, I fear, seriously so; and this 
combination of two invalids very much depresses both.
</p><p>I have a volume of republished essays coming out with Chatto and 
Windus; I wish they would come, that my wife might have the reviews 
to divert her.  Otherwise my news is NIL.  I am up here in a little 
chalet, on the borders of a pinewood, overlooking a great part of 
the Davos Thal, a beautiful scene at night, with the moon upon the 
snowy mountains, and the lights warmly shining in the village.  J. 
A. Symonds is next door to me, just at the foot of my Hill 
Difficulty (this you will please regard as the House Beautiful), 
and his society is my great stand-by.
</p><p>Did you see I had joined the band of the rejected?  'Hardly one of 
us,' said my CONFRERES at the bar.
</p><p>I was blamed by a common friend for asking you to give me a 
testimonial; in the circumstances he thought it was indelicate.  
Lest, by some calamity, you should ever have felt the same way, I 
must say in two words how the matter appeared to me.  That silly 
story of the election altered in no tittle the value of your 
testimony:  so much for that.  On the other hand, it led me to take 
quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it; and so much 
for the other.  I trust, even if you cannot share it, you will 
understand my view.
</p><p>I am in treaty with Bentley for a life of Hazlitt; I hope it will 
not fall through, as I love the subject, and appear to have found a 
publisher who loves it also.  That, I think, makes things more 
pleasant.  You know I am a fervent Hazlittite; I mean regarding him 
as THE English writer who has had the scantiest justice.  Besides 
which, I am anxious to write biography; really, if I understand 
myself in quest of profit, I think it must be good to live with 
another man from birth to death.  You have tried it, and know.
</p><p>How has the cruising gone?  Pray remember me to Mrs. Hamerton and 
your son, and believe me, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN], DAVOS, DECEMBER 5, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - We have been in miserable case here; my wife 
worse and worse; and now sent away with Lloyd for sick nurse, I not 
being allowed to go down.  I do not know what is to become of us; 
and you may imagine how rotten I have been feeling, and feel now, 
alone with my weasel-dog and my German maid, on the top of a hill 
here, heavy mist and thin snow all about me, and the devil to pay 
in general.  I don't care so much for solitude as I used to; 
results, I suppose, of marriage.
</p><p>Pray write me something cheery.  A little Edinburgh gossip, in 
Heaven's name.  Ah! what would I not give to steal this evening 
with you through the big, echoing, college archway, and away south 
under the street lamps, and away to dear Brash's, now defunct!  But 
the old time is dead also, never, never to revive.  It was a sad 
time too, but so gay and so hopeful, and we had such sport with all 
our low spirits and all our distresses, that it looks like a kind 
of lamplit fairyland behind me.  O for ten Edinburgh minutes - 
sixpence between us, and the ever-glorious Lothian Road, or dear 
mysterious Leith Walk!  But here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom 
Bowling; here in this strange place, whose very strangeness would 
have been heaven to him then; and aspires, yes, C. B., with tears, 
after the past.  See what comes of being left alone.  Do you 
remember Brash? the sheet of glass that we followed along George 
Street?  Granton? the blight at Bonny mainhead? the compass near 
the sign of the TWINKLING EYE? the night I lay on the pavement in 
misery?
</p><p>I swear it by the eternal sky
Johnson - nor Thomson - ne'er shall die!
</p><p>Yet I fancy they are dead too; dead like Brash.

<p>Letter:  TO MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET BUOL, DAVOS-PLATZ, DECEMBER 26, 1881.
</p><p>MY DEAR MOTHER, - Yesterday, Sunday and Christmas, we finished this 
eventful journey by a drive in an OPEN sleigh - none others were to 
be had - seven hours on end through whole forests of Christmas 
trees.  The cold was beyond belief.  I have often suffered less at 
a dentist's.  It was a clear, sunny day, but the sun even at noon 
falls, at this season, only here and there into the Prattigau.  I 
kept up as long as I could in an imitation of a street singer:-
</p><p>Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses, etc.
</p><p>At last Lloyd remarked, a blue mouth speaking from a corpse-
coloured face, 'You seem to be the only one with any courage left?'  
And, do you know, with that word my courage disappeared, and I made 
the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others.  
My only terror was lest Fanny should ask for brandy, or laudanum, 
or something.  So awful was the idea of putting my hands out, that 
I half thought I would refuse.
</p><p>Well, none of us are a penny the worse, Lloyd's cold better; I, 
with a twinge of the rheumatic; and Fanny better than her ordinary.
</p><p>General conclusion between Lloyd and me as to the journey:  A 
prolonged visit to the dentist's, complicated with the fear of 
death.
</p><p>Never, O never, do you get me there again. - Ever affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS-PLATZ, FEBRUARY 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR CUMMY, - My wife and I are very much vexed to hear you are 
still unwell.  We are both keeping far better; she especially seems 
quite to have taken a turn - THE turn, we shall hope.  Please let 
us know how you get on, and what has been the matter with you; 
Braemar I believe - the vile hole.  You know what a lazy rascal I 
am, so you won't be surprised at a short letter, I know; indeed, 
you will be much more surprised at my having had the decency to 
write at all.  We have got rid of our young, pretty, and 
incompetent maid; and now we have a fine, canny, twinkling, shrewd, 
auld-farrant peasant body, who gives us good food and keeps us in 
good spirits.  If we could only understand what she says!  But she 
speaks Davos language, which is to German what Aberdeen-awa' is to 
English, so it comes heavy.  God bless you, my dear Cummy; and so 
says Fanny forbye. - Ever your affectionate,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Your most welcome letter has raised clouds of 
sulphur from my horizon. . . .
</p><p>I am glad you have gone back to your music.  Life is a poor thing, 
I am more and more convinced, without an art, that always waits for 
us and is always new.  Art and marriage are two very good stand-

</p><p>In an article which will appear sometime in the CORNHILL, 'Talk and

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS-PLATZ, FEBRUARY 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - Here comes the letter as promised last night.  
And first two requests:  Pray send the enclosed to c/o Blackmore's 
publisher, 'tis from Fanny; second, pray send us Routledge's 
shilling book, Edward Mayhew's DOGS, by return if it can be 
managed.
</p><p>Our dog is very ill again, poor fellow, looks very ill too, only 
sleeps at night because of morphine; and we do not know what ails 
him, only fear it to be canker of the ear.  He makes a bad, black 
spot in our life, poor, selfish, silly, little tangle; and my wife 
is wretched.  Otherwise she is better, steadily and slowly moving 
up through all her relapses.  My knee never gets the least better; 
it hurts to-night, which it has not done for long.  I do not 
suppose my doctor knows any least thing about it.  He says it is a 
nerve that I struck, but I assure you he does not know.
</p><p>I have just finished a paper, 'A Gossip on Romance,' in which I 
have tried to do, very popularly, about one-half of the matter you 
wanted me to try.  In a way, I have found an answer to the 
question.  But the subject was hardly fit for so chatty a paper, 
and it is all loose ends.  If ever I do my book on the Art of 
Literature, I shall gather them together and be clear.
</p><p>To-morrow, having once finished off the touches still due on this, 
I shall tackle SAN FRANCISCO for you.  Then the tide of work will 
fairly bury me, lost to view and hope.  You have no idea what it 
costs me to wring out my work now.  I have certainly been a 
fortnight over this Romance, sometimes five hours a day; and yet it 
is about my usual length - eight pages or so, and would be a d-d 
sight the better for another curry.  But I do not think I can 
honestly re-write it all; so I call it done, and shall only 
straighten words in a revision currently.
</p><p>I had meant to go on for a great while, and say all manner of 
entertaining things.  But all's gone.  I am now an idiot. - Yours 
ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, MARCH 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - . . . Last night we had a dinner-party, 
consisting of the John Addington, curry, onions (lovely onions), 
and beefsteak.  So unusual is any excitement, that F. and I feel 
this morning as if we had been to a coronation.  However I must, I 
suppose, write.
</p><p>I was sorry about your female contributor squabble.  'Tis very 
comic, but really unpleasant.  But what care I?  Now that I 
illustrate my own books, I can always offer you a situation in our 
house - S.  L. Osbourne and Co.  As an author gets a halfpenny a 
copy of verses, and an artist a penny a cut, perhaps a proof-reader 
might get several pounds a year.
</p><p>O that Coronation!  What a shouting crowd there was!  I obviously 
got a firework in each eye.  The king looked very magnificent, to 
be sure; and that great hall where we feasted on seven hundred 
delicate foods, and drank fifty royal wines - QUEL COUP D'OEIL! but 
was it not over-done, even for a coronation - almost a vulgar 
luxury?  And eleven is certainly too late to begin dinner.  (It was 
really 6.30 instead of 5.30.)
</p><p>Your list of books that Cassells have refused in these weeks is not 
quite complete; they also refused:-
</p><p>1. Six undiscovered Tragedies, one romantic Comedy, a fragment of 
Journal extending over six years, and an unfinished Autobiography 
reaching up to the first performance of King John.  By William 
Shakespeare.
</p><p>2. The journals and Private Correspondence of David, King of 
Israel.
</p><p>3. Poetical Works of Arthur, Iron Dook of Wellington, including a 
Monody on Napoleon.
</p><p>4. Eight books of an unfinished novel, SOLOMON CRABB.  By Henry 
Fielding.
</p><p>5. Stevenson's Moral Emblems.
</p><p>You also neglected to mention, as PER CONTRA, that they had during 
the same time accepted and triumphantly published Brown's HANDBOOK 
TO CRICKET, Jones's FIRST FRENCH READER, and Robinson's PICTURESQUE 
CHESHIRE, uniform with the same author's STATELY HOMES OF SALOP.
</p><p>O if that list could come true!  How we would tear at Solomon 
Crabb!  O what a bully, bully, bully business.  Which would you 
read first - Shakespeare's autobiography, or his journals?  What 
sport the monody on Napoleon would be - what wooden verse, what 
stucco ornament!  I should read both the autobiography and the 
journals before I looked at one of the plays, beyond the names of 
them, which shows that Saintsbury was right, and I do care more for 
life than for poetry.  No - I take it back.  Do you know one of the 
tragedies - a Bible tragedy too - DAVID - was written in his third 
period - much about the same time as Lear?  The comedy, APRIL RAIN, 
is also a late work.  BECKETT is a fine ranting piece, like RICHARD 
II., but very fine for the stage.  Irving is to play it this autumn 
when I'm in town; the part rather suits him - but who is to play 
Henry - a tremendous creation, sir.  Betterton in his private 
journal seems to have seen this piece; and he says distinctly that 
Henry is the best part in any play.  'Though,' he adds, 'how it be 
with the ancient plays I know not.  But in this I have ever feared 
to do ill, and indeed will not be persuaded to that undertaking.'  
So says Betterton.  RUFUS is not so good; I am not pleased with 
RUFUS; plainly a RIFACCIMENTO of some inferior work; but there are 
some damned fine lines.  As for the purely satiric ill-minded 
ABELARD AND HELOISE, another TROILUS, QUOI! it is not pleasant, 
truly, but what strength, what verve, what knowledge of life, and 
the Canon!  What a finished, humorous, rich picture is the Canon!  
Ah, there was nobody like Shakespeare.  But what I like is the 
David and Absalom business.  Absalom is so well felt - you love him 
as David did; David's speech is one roll of royal music from the 
first act to the fifth.
</p><p>I am enjoying SOLOMON CRABB extremely; Solomon's capital adventure 
with the two highwaymen and Squire Trecothick and Parson Vance; it 
is as good, I think, as anything in Joseph Andrews.  I have just 
come to the part where the highwayman with the black patch over his 
eye has tricked poor Solomon into his place, and the squire and the 
parson are hearing the evidence.  Parson Vance is splendid.  How 
good, too, is old Mrs. Crabb and the coastguardsman in the third 
chapter, or her delightful quarrel with the sexton of Seaham; Lord 
Conybeare is surely a little overdone; but I don't know either; 
he's such damned fine sport.  Do you like Sally Barnes?  I'm in 
love with her.  Constable Muddon is as good as Dogberry and Verges 
put together; when he takes Solomon to the cage, and the highwayman 
gives him Solomon's own guinea for his pains, and kisses Mrs. 
Muddon, and just then up drives Lord Conybeare, and instead of 
helping Solomon, calls him all the rascals in Christendom - O Henry 
Fielding, Henry Fielding!  Yet perhaps the scenes at Seaham are the 
best.  But I'm bewildered among all these excellences.
</p><p>Stay, cried a voice that made the welkin crack -
This here's a dream, return and study BLACK!
</p><p>- Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p>Letter:  TO ALEXANDER IRELAND
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, MARCH 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR SIR, - This formidable paper need not alarm you; it argues 
nothing beyond penury of other sorts, and is not at all likely to 
lead me into a long letter.  If I were at all grateful it would, 
for yours has just passed for me a considerable part of a stormy 
evening.  And speaking of gratitude, let me at once and with 
becoming eagerness accept your kind invitation to Bowdon.  I shall 
hope, if we can agree as to dates when I am nearer hand, to come to 
you sometime in the month of May.  I was pleased to hear you were a 
Scot; I feel more at home with my compatriots always; perhaps the 
more we are away, the stronger we feel that bond.
</p><p>You ask about Davos; I have discoursed about it already, rather 
sillily I think, in the PALL MALL, and I mean to say no more, but 
the ways of the Muse are dubious and obscure, and who knows?  I may 
be wiled again.  As a place of residence, beyond a splendid 
climate, it has to my eyes but one advantage - the neighbourhood of 
J. A. Symonds - I dare say you know his work, but the man is far 
more interesting.  It has done me, in my two winters' Alpine exile, 
much good; so much, that I hope to leave it now for ever, but would 
not be understood to boast.  In my present unpardonably crazy 
state, any cold might send me skipping, either back to Davos, or 
further off.  Let us hope not.  It is dear; a little dreary; very 
far from many things that both my taste and my needs prompt me to 
seek; and altogether not the place that I should choose of my free 
will.
</p><p>I am chilled by your description of the man in question, though I 
had almost argued so much from his cold and undigested volume.  If 
the republication does not interfere with my publisher, it will not 
interfere with me; but there, of course, comes the hitch.  I do not 
know Mr. Bentley, and I fear all publishers like the devil from 
legend and experience both.  However, when I come to town, we 
shall, I hope, meet and understand each other as well as author and 
publisher ever do.  I liked his letters; they seemed hearty, kind, 
and personal.  Still - I am notedly suspicious of the trade - your 
news of this republication alarms me.
</p><p>The best of the present French novelists seems to me, incomparably, 
Daudet.  LES ROIS EN EXIL comes very near being a masterpiece.  For 
Zola I have no toleration, though the curious, eminently bourgeois, 
and eminently French creature has power of a kind.  But I would he 
were deleted.  I would not give a chapter of old Dumas (meaning 
himself, not his collaborators) for the whole boiling of the Zolas.  
Romance with the smallpox - as the great one:  diseased anyway and 
blackhearted and fundamentally at enmity with joy.
</p><p>I trust that Mrs. Ireland does not object to smoking; and if you 
are a teetotaller, I beg you to mention it before I come - I have 
all the vices; some of the virtues also, let us hope - that, at 
least, of being a Scotchman, and yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - My father was in the old High School the last year, and 
walked in the procession to the new.  I blush to own I am an 
Academy boy; it seems modern, and smacks not of the soil.
</p><p>P.P.S. - I enclose a good joke - at least, I think so - my first 
efforts at wood engraving printed by my stepson, a boy of thirteen.  
I will put in also one of my later attempts.  I have been nine days 
at the art - observe my progress.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>DAVOS, MARCH 23, 1882.
</p><p>MY DEAR WEG, - And I had just written the best note to Mrs. Gosse 
that was in my power.  Most blameable.
</p><p>I now send (for Mrs. Gosse).
</p><p>BLACK CANYON.
</p><p>Also an advertisement of my new appearance as poet (bard, rather) 
and hartis on wood.  The cut represents the Hero and the Eagle, and 
is emblematic of Cortez first viewing the Pacific Ocean, which 
(according to the bard Keats) it took place in Darien.  The cut is 
much admired for the sentiment of discovery, the manly proportions 
of the voyager, and the fine impression of tropical scenes and the 
untrodden WASTE, so aptly rendered by the hartis.
</p><p>I would send you the book; but I declare I'm ruined.  I got a penny 
a cut and a halfpenny a set of verses from the flint-hearted 
publisher, and only one specimen copy, as I'm a sinner.  - was 
apostolic alongside of Osbourne.
</p><p>I hope you will be able to decipher this, written at steam speed 
with a breaking pen, the hotfast postman at my heels.  No excuse, 
says you.  None, sir, says I, and touches my 'at most civil 
(extraordinary evolution of pen, now quite doomed - to resume - )  
I have not put pen to the Bloody Murder yet.  But it is early on my 
list; and when once I get to it, three weeks should see the last 
bloodstain - maybe a fortnight.  For I am beginning to combine an 
extraordinary laborious slowness while at work, with the most 
surprisingly quick results in the way of finished manuscripts.  How 
goes Gray?  Colvin is to do Keats.  My wife is still not well. - 
Yours ever,

</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, MARCH 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. JAPP, - You must think me a forgetful rogue, as indeed 
I am; for I have but now told my publisher to send you a copy of 
the FAMILIAR STUDIES.  However, I own I have delayed this letter 
till I could send you the enclosed.  Remembering the nights at 
Braemar when we visited the Picture Gallery, I hoped they might

<p>Letter:  TO DR. ALEXANDER JAPP
</p><p><br />
</p><p>CHALET BUOL, DAVOS, APRIL 1, 1882.
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. JAPP, - A good day to date this letter, which is in 
fact a confession of incapacity.  During my wife's illness I 
somewhat lost my head, and entirely lost a great quire of corrected 
proofs.  This is one of the results; I hope there are none more 
serious.  I was never so sick of any volume as I was of that; was 
continually receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal 
difficulties.  I was ill - I did really fear my wife was worse than 
ill.  Well, it's out now; and though I have observed several 
carelessnesses myself, and now here's another of your finding - of 
which, indeed, I ought to be ashamed - it will only justify the 
sweeping humility of the Preface.
</p><p>Symonds was actually dining with us when your letter came, and I 
communicated your remarks. . . . He is a far better and more 
interesting thing than any of his books.
</p><p>The Elephant was my wife's; so she is proportionately elate you 
should have picked it out for praise - from a collection, let me 
add, so replete with the highest qualities of art.
</p><p>My wicked carcase, as John Knox calls it, holds together 
wonderfully.  In addition to many other things, and a volume of 
travel, I find I have written, since December, 90 CORNHILL pages of 
magazine work - essays and stories:  40,000 words, and I am none 
the worse - I am the better.  I begin to hope I may, if not outlive 
this wolverine upon my shoulders, at least carry him bravely like 
Symonds and Alexander Pope.  I begin to take a pride in that hope.
</p><p>I shall be much interested to see your criticisms; you might 
perhaps send them to me.  I believe you know that is not dangerous; 
one folly I have not - I am not touchy under criticism.
</p><p>Lloyd and my wife both beg to be remembered; and Lloyd sends as a 
present a work of his own.  I hope you feel flattered; for this is 
SIMPLY THE FIRST TIME HE HAS EVER GIVEN ONE AWAY.  I have to buy my 
own works, I can tell you. - Yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, APRIL 1882.]
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - I hope and hope for a long letter - soon I hope 
to be superseded by long talks - and it comes not.  I remember I 
have never formally thanked you for that hundred quid, nor in 
general for the introduction to Chatto and Windus, and continue to 
bury you in copy as if you were my private secretary.  Well, I am 
not unconscious of it all; but I think least said is often best, 
generally best; gratitude is a tedious sentiment, it's not ductile, 
not dramatic.
</p><p>If Chatto should take both, CUI DEDICARE?  I am running out of 
dedikees; if I do, the whole fun of writing is stranded.  TREASURE 
ISLAND, if it comes out, and I mean it shall, of course goes to 
Lloyd.  Lemme see, I have now dedicated to
</p><p>W. E. H. [William Ernest Henley].
</p><p>S. C. [Sidney Colvin].
</p><p>T. S. [Thomas Stevenson].
</p><p>Simp. [Sir Walter Simpson].
</p><p>There remain:  C. B., the Williamses - you know they were the 
parties who stuck up for us about our marriage, and Mrs. W. was my 
guardian angel, and our Best Man and Bridesmaid rolled in one, and 
the only third of the wedding party - my sister-in-law, who is 
booked for PRINCE OTTO - Jenkin I suppose sometime - George 
Meredith, the only man of genius of my acquaintance, and then I 
believe I'll have to take to the dead, the immortal memory 
business.
</p><p>Talking of Meredith, I have just re-read for the third and fourth 
time THE EGOIST.  When I shall have read it the sixth or seventh, I 
begin to see I shall know about it.  You will be astonished when 
you come to re-read it; I had no idea of the matter - human, red 
matter he has contrived to plug and pack into that strange and 
admirable book.  Willoughby is, of course, a pure discovery; a 
complete set of nerves, not heretofore examined, and yet running 
all over the human body - a suit of nerves.  Clara is the best girl 
ever I saw anywhere.  Vernon is almost as good.  The manner and the 
faults of the book greatly justify themselves on further study.  
Only Dr. Middleton does not hang together; and Ladies Busshe and 
Culmer SONT DES MONSTRUOSITES.  Vernon's conduct makes a wonderful 
odd contrast with Daniel Deronda's.  I see more and more that 
Meredith is built for immortality.
</p><p>Talking of which, Heywood, as a small immortal, an immortalet, 
claims some attention.  THE WOMAN KILLED WITH KINDNESS is one of 
the most striking novels - not plays, though it's more of a play 
than anything else of his - I ever read.  He had such a sweet, 
sound soul, the old boy.  The death of the two pirates in FORTUNE 
BY SEA AND LAND is a document.  He had obviously been present, and 
heard Purser and Clinton take death by the beard with similar 
braggadocios.  Purser and Clinton, names of pirates; Scarlet and 
Bobbington, names of highwaymen.  He had the touch of names, I 
think.  No man I ever knew had such a sense, such a tact, for 
English nomenclature:  Rainsforth, Lacy, Audley, Forrest, Acton, 
Spencer, Frankford - so his names run.
</p><p>Byron not only wrote DON JUAN; he called Joan of Arc 'a fanatical 
strumpet.'  These are his words.  I think the double shame, first 
to a great poet, second to an English noble, passes words.
</p><p>Here is a strange gossip. - I am yours loquaciously,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>My lungs are said to be in a splendid state.  A cruel examination, 
an exaNIMation I may call it, had this brave result.  TAIAUT!  
Hillo!  Hey!  Stand by!  Avast!  Hurrah!

</p><p>My dear mother, how can I keep up with your breathless changes?   
Innerleithen, Cramond, Bridge of Allan, Dunblane, Selkirk.  I lean 
to Cramond, but I shall be pleased anywhere, any respite from 
Davos; never mind, it has been a good, though a dear lesson.  Now, 
with my improved health, if I can pass the summer, I believe I 
shall be able no more to exceed, no more to draw on you.  It is 
time I sufficed for myself indeed.  And I believe I can.
</p><p>I am still far from satisfied about Fanny; she is certainly better, 
but it is by fits a good deal, and the symptoms continue, which 
should not be.  I had her persuaded to leave without me this very 
day (Saturday 8th), but the disclosure of my mismanagement broke up 
that plan; she would not leave me lest I should mismanage more.  I 
think this an unfair revenge; but I have been so bothered that I 
cannot struggle.  All Davos has been drinking our wine.  During the 
month of March, three litres a day were drunk - O it is too 
sickening - and that is only a specimen.  It is enough to make any 
one a misanthrope, but the right thing is to hate the donkey that 
was duped - which I devoutly do.
</p><p>I have this winter finished TREASURE ISLAND, written the preface to 
the STUDIES, a small book about the INLAND VOYAGE size, THE 
SILVERADO SQUATTERS, and over and above that upwards of ninety (90) 
CORNHILL pages of magazine work.  No man can say I have been idle. 
- Your affectionate son,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH] SUNDAY [JUNE 1882].
</p><p>. . . NOTE turned up, but no gray opuscule, which, however, will 
probably turn up to-morrow in time to go out with me to Stobo 
Manse, Peeblesshire, where, if you can make it out, you will be a 
good soul to pay a visit.  I shall write again about the opuscule; 
and about Stobo, which I have not seen since I was thirteen, though 
my memory speaks delightfully of it.
</p><p>I have been very tired and seedy, or I should have written before, 
INTER ALIA, to tell you that I had visited my murder place and 
found LIVING TRADITIONS not yet in any printed book; most 
startling.  I also got photographs taken, but the negatives have 
not yet turned up.  I lie on the sofa to write this, whence the 
pencil; having slept yesterdays - 1+4+7.5 = 12.5 hours and being (9 
A.M.) very anxious to sleep again.  The arms of Porpus, quoi!  A 
poppy gules, etc.
</p><p>From Stobo you can conquer Peebles and Selkirk, or to give them 
their old decent names, Tweeddale and Ettrick.  Think of having 
been called Tweeddale, and being called PEEBLES!  Did I ever tell 
you my skit on my own travel books?  We understand that Mr. 
Stevenson has in the press another volume of unconventional 
travels:  PERSONAL ADVENTURES IN PEEBLESSHIRE.  JE LA TROUVE 
MECHANTE. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>- Did I say I had seen a verse on two of the Buccaneers?  I did, 
and CA-Y-EST.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE
</p><p><br />
</p><p>STOBO MANSE, PEEBLESSHIRE [JULY 1882].
</p><p>I would shoot you, but I have no bow:
The place is not called Stobs, but Stobo.
As Gallic Kids complain of 'Bobo,'
I mourn for your mistake of Stobo.
</p><p>First, we shall be gone in September.  But if you think of coming 
in August, my mother will hunt for you with pleasure.  We should 
all be overjoyed - though Stobo it could not be, as it is but a 
kirk and manse, but possibly somewhere within reach.  Let us know.
</p><p>Second, I have read your Gray with care.  A more difficult subject 
I can scarce fancy; it is crushing; yet I think you have managed to 
shadow forth a man, and a good man too; and honestly, I doubt if I 
could have done the same.  This may seem egoistic; but you are not 
such a fool as to think so.  It is the natural expression of real 
praise.  The book as a whole is readable; your subject peeps every 
here and there out of the crannies like a shy violet - he could do 
no more - and his aroma hangs there.
</p><p>I write to catch a minion of the post.  Hence brevity.  Answer 
about the house. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L S.

<p>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[STOBO MANSE, JULY 1882.]
</p><p>DEAR HENLEY, . . . I am not worth an old damn.  I am also crushed 
by bad news of Symonds; his good lung going; I cannot help reading 
it as a personal hint; God help us all!  Really I am not very fit 
for work; but I try, try, and nothing comes of it.
</p><p>I believe we shall have to leave this place; it is low, damp, and 
MAUCHY; the rain it raineth every day; and the glass goes tol-de-
rol-de riddle.
</p><p>Yet it's a bonny bit; I wish I could live in it, but doubt.  I wish 
I was well away somewhere else.  I feel like flight some days; 
honour bright.
</p><p>Pirbright Smith is well.  Old Mr. Pegfurth Bannatyne is here 
staying at a country inn.  His whole baggage is a pair of socks and 
a book in a fishing-basket; and he borrows even a rod from the 
landlord.  He walked here over the hills from Sanquhar, 'singin', 
he says, 'like a mavis.'  I naturally asked him about Hazlitt.  'He 
wouldnae take his drink,' he said, 'a queer, queer fellow.'  But 
did not seem further communicative.  He says he has become 
'releegious,' but still swears like a trooper.  I asked him if he 
had no headquarters.  'No likely,' said he.  He says he is writing 
his memoirs, which will be interesting.  He once met Borrow; they 
boxed; 'and Geordie,' says the old man chuckling, 'gave me the 
damnedest hiding.'  Of Wordsworth he remarked, 'He wasnae sound in 
the faith, sir, and a milk-blooded, blue-spectacled bitch forbye.  
But his po'mes are grand - there's no denying that.'  I asked him 
what his book was.  'I havenae mind,' said he - that was his only 
book!  On turning it out, I found it was one of my own, and on 
showing it to him, he remembered it at once.  'O aye,' he said, 'I 
mind now.  It's pretty bad; ye'll have to do better than that, 
chieldy,' and chuckled, chuckled.  He is a strange old figure, to 
be sure.  He cannot endure Pirbright Smith - 'a mere aesthAtic,' he 
said.  'Pooh!'  'Fishin' and releegion - these are my aysthatics,' 
he wound up.
</p><p>I thought this would interest you, so scribbled it down.  I still 
hope to get more out of him about Hazlitt, though he utterly pooh-
poohed the idea of writing H.'s life.  'Ma life now,' he said, 
'there's been queer things in IT.'  He is seventy-nine! but may 
well last to a hundred! - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L S.
