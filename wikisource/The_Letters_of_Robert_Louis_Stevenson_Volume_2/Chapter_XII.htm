<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[APRIL, 1893.]
</p><p>. . . About THE JUSTICE-CLERK, I long to go at it, but will first 
try to get a short story done.  Since January I have had two severe 
illnesses, my boy, and some heart-breaking anxiety over Fanny; and 
am only now convalescing.  I came down to dinner last night for the 
first time, and that only because the service had broken down, and 
to relieve an inexperienced servant.  Nearly four months now I have 
rested my brains; and if it be true that rest is good for brains, I 
ought to be able to pitch in like a giant refreshed.  Before the 
autumn, I hope to send you some JUSTICE-CLERK, or WEIR OF 
HERMISTON, as Colvin seems to prefer; I own to indecision.  
Received SYNTAX, DANCE OF DEATH, and PITCAIRN, which last I have 
read from end to end since its arrival, with vast improvement.  
What a pity it stops so soon!  I wonder is there nothing that seems 
to prolong the series?  Why doesn't some young man take it up?  How 
about my old friend Fountainhall's DECISIONS?  I remember as a boy 
that there was some good reading there.  Perhaps you could borrow 
me that, and send it on loan; and perhaps Laing's MEMORIALS 
therewith; and a work I'm ashamed to say I have never read, 
BALFOUR'S LETTERS. . . . I have come by accident, through a 
correspondent, on one very curious and interesting fact - namely, 
that Stevenson was one of the names adopted by the MacGregors at 
the proscription.  The details supplied by my correspondent are 
both convincing and amusing; but it would be highly interesting to 
find out more of this.

<p><b>Letter:  TO A. CONAN DOYLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, APIA, SAMOA, APRIL 5TH, 1893.
</p><p>DEAR SIR, - You have taken many occasions to make yourself very 
agreeable to me, for which I might in decency have thanked you 
earlier.  It is now my turn; and I hope you will allow me to offer 
you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting 
adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  That is the class of literature 
that I like when I have the toothache.  As a matter of fact, it was 
a pleurisy I was enjoying when I took the volume up; and it will 
interest you as a medical man to know that the cure was for the 
moment effectual.  Only the one thing troubles me:  can this be my 
old friend Joe Bell? - I am, yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - And lo, here is your address supplied me here in Samoa!  But 
do not take mine, O frolic fellow Spookist, from the same source; 
mine is wrong.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO S. R. CROCKETT</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, MAY 17TH, 1893.
</p><p>DEAR MR. CROCKETT, - I do not owe you two letters, nor yet nearly 
one, sir!  The last time I heard of you, you wrote about an 
accident, and I sent you a letter to my lawyer, Charles Baxter, 
which does not seem to have been presented, as I see nothing of it 
in his accounts.  Query, was that lost?  I should not like you to 
think I had been so unmannerly and so inhuman.  If you have written 
since, your letter also has miscarried, as is much the rule in this 
part of the world, unless you register.
</p><p>Your book is not yet to hand, but will probably follow next month.  
I detected you early in the BOOKMAN, which I usually see, and noted 
you in particular as displaying a monstrous ingratitude about the 
footnote.  Well, mankind is ungrateful; 'Man's ingratitude to man 
makes countless thousands mourn,' quo' Rab - or words to that 
effect.  By the way, an anecdote of a cautious sailor:  'Bill, 
Bill,' says I to him, 'OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.'
</p><p>I shall never take that walk by the Fisher's Tryst and Glencorse.  
I shall never see Auld Reekie.  I shall never set my foot again 
upon the heather.  Here I am until I die, and here will I be 
buried.  The word is out and the doom written.  Or, if I do come, 
it will be a voyage to a further goal, and in fact a suicide; 
which, however, if I could get my family all fixed up in the money 
way, I might, perhaps, perform, or attempt.  But there is a plaguey 
risk of breaking down by the way; and I believe I shall stay here 
until the end comes like a good boy, as I am.  If I did it, I 
should put upon my trunks:  'Passenger to - Hades.'  How strangely 
wrong your information is!  In the first place, I should never 
carry a novel to Sydney; I should post it from here.  In the second 
place, WEIR OF HERMISTON is as yet scarce begun.  It's going to be 
excellent, no doubt; but it consists of about twenty pages.  I have 
a tale, a shortish tale in length, but it has proved long to do, 
THE EBB TIDE, some part of which goes home this mail.  It is by me 
and Mr. Osbourne, and is really a singular work.  There are only 
four characters, and three of them are bandits - well, two of them 
are, and the third is their comrade and accomplice.  It sounds 
cheering, doesn't it?  Barratry, and drunkenness, and vitriol, and 
I cannot tell you all what, are the beams of the roof.  And yet - I 
don't know - I sort of think there's something in it.  You'll see 
(which is more than I ever can) whether Davis and Attwater come off 
or not.
</p><p>WEIR OF HERMISTON is a much greater undertaking, and the plot is 
not good, I fear; but Lord Justice-Clerk Hermiston ought to be a 
plum.  Of other schemes, more or less executed, it skills not to 
speak.
</p><p>I am glad to hear so good an account of your activity and 
interests, and shall always hear from you with pleasure; though I 
am, and must continue, a mere sprite of the inkbottle, unseen in 
the flesh.  Please remember me to your wife and to the four-year-
old sweetheart, if she be not too engrossed with higher matters.  
Do you know where the road crosses the burn under Glencorse Church?  
Go there, and say a prayer for me:  MORITURUS SALUTAT.  See that 
it's a sunny day; I would like it to be a Sunday, but that's not 
possible in the premises; and stand on the right-hand bank just 
where the road goes down into the water, and shut your eyes, and if 
I don't appear to you! well, it can't be helped, and will be 
extremely funny.
</p><p>I have no concern here but to work and to keep an eye on this 
distracted people.  I live just now wholly alone in an upper room 
of my house, because the whole family are down with influenza, bar 
my wife and myself.  I get my horse up sometimes in the afternoon 
and have a ride in the woods; and I sit here and smoke and write, 
and rewrite, and destroy, and rage at my own impotence, from six in 
the morning till eight at night, with trifling and not always 
agreeable intervals for meals.
</p><p>I am sure you chose wisely to keep your country charge.  There a 
minister can be something, not in a town.  In a town, the most of 
them are empty houses - and public speakers.  Why should you 
suppose your book will be slated because you have no friends?  A 
new writer, if he is any good, will be acclaimed generally with 
more noise than he deserves.  But by this time you will know for 
certain. - I am, yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - Be it known to this fluent generation that I R. L. S., in 
the forty-third of my age and the twentieth of my professional 
life, wrote twenty-four pages in twenty-one days, working from six 
to eleven, and again in the afternoon from two to four or so, 
without fail or interruption.  Such are the gifts the gods have 
endowed us withal:  such was the facility of this prolific writer!
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO AUGUSTUS ST. GAUDENS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, MAY 29TH, 1893
</p><p>MY DEAR GOD-LIKE SCULPTOR, - I wish in the most delicate manner in 
the world to insinuate a few commissions:-
</p><p>No. 1. Is for a couple of copies of my medallion, as gilt-edged and 
high-toned as it is possible to make them.  One is for our house 
here, and should be addressed as above.  The other is for my friend 
Sidney Colvin, and should be addressed - Sidney Colvin, Esq., 
Keeper of the Print Room, British Museum, London.
</p><p>No. 2. This is a rather large order, and demands some explanation.  
Our house is lined with varnished wood of a dark ruddy colour, very 
beautiful to see; at the same time, it calls very much for gold; 
there is a limit to picture frames, and really you know there has 
to be a limit to the pictures you put inside of them.  Accordingly, 
we have had an idea of a certain kind of decoration, which, I 
think, you might help us to make practical.  What we want is an 
alphabet of gilt letters (very much such as people play with), and 
all mounted on spikes like drawing-pins; say two spikes to each 
letter, one at top, and one at bottom.  Say that they were this 
height,
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I</dd>
<dd>I</dd>
<dd>I</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>and that you chose a model of some really exquisitely fine, clear 
type from some Roman monument, and that they were made either of 
metal or some composition gilt - the point is, could not you, in 
your land of wooden houses, get a manufacturer to take the idea and 
manufacture them at a venture, so that I could get two or three 
hundred pieces or so at a moderate figure?  You see, suppose you 
entertain an honoured guest, when he goes he leaves his name in 
gilt letters on your walls; an infinity of fun and decoration can 
be got out of hospitable and festive mottoes; and the doors of 
every room can be beautified by the legend of their names.  I 
really think there is something in the idea, and you might be able 
to push it with the brutal and licentious manufacturer, using my 
name if necessary, though I should think the name of the god-like 
sculptor would be more germane.  In case you should get it started, 
I should tell you that we should require commas in order to write 
the Samoan language, which is full of words written thus:  la'u, 
ti'e ti'e.  As the Samoan language uses but a very small proportion 
of the consonants, we should require a double or treble stock of 
all vowels and of F, G, L, U, N, P, S, T, and V.
</p><p>The other day in Sydney, I think you might be interested to hear, I 
was sculpt a second time by a man called -, as well as I can 
remember and read.  I mustn't criticise a present, and he had very 
little time to do it in.  It is thought by my family to be an 
excellent likeness of Mark Twain.  This poor fellow, by the by, met 
with the devil of an accident.  A model of a statue which he had 
just finished with a desperate effort was smashed to smithereens on 
its way to exhibition.
</p><p>Please be sure and let me know if anything is likely to come of 
this letter business, and the exact cost of each letter, so that I 
may count the cost before ordering. - Yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>JUNE 10TH, 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - My mother tells me you never received the very 
long and careful letter that I sent you more than a year ago; or is 
it two years?
</p><p>I was indeed so much surprised at your silence that I wrote to 
Henry James and begged him to inquire if you had received it; his 
reply was an (if possible) higher power of the same silence; 
whereupon I bowed my head and acquiesced.  But there is no doubt 
the letter was written and sent; and I am sorry it was lost, for it 
contained, among other things, an irrecoverable criticism of your 
father's LIFE, with a number of suggestions for another edition, 
which struck me at the time as excellent.
</p><p>Well, suppose we call that cried off, and begin as before?  It is 
fortunate indeed that we can do so, being both for a while longer 
in the day.  But, alas! when I see 'works of the late J. A. S.,'  I 
can see no help and no reconciliation possible.  I wrote him a 
letter, I think, three years ago, heard in some roundabout way that 
he had received it, waited in vain for an answer (which had 
probably miscarried), and in a humour between frowns and smiles 
wrote to him no more.  And now the strange, poignant, pathetic, 
brilliant creature is gone into the night, and the voice is silent 
that uttered so much excellent discourse; and I am sorry that I did 
not write to him again.  Yet I am glad for him; light lie the turf!  
The SATURDAY is the only obituary I have seen, and I thought it 
very good upon the whole.  I should be half tempted to write an IN 
MEMORIAM, but I am submerged with other work.  Are you going to do 
it?  I very much admire your efforts that way; you are our only 
academician.
</p><p>So you have tried fiction?  I will tell you the truth:  when I saw 
it announced, I was so sure you would send it to me, that I did not 
order it!  But the order goes this mail, and I will give you news 
of it.  Yes, honestly, fiction is very difficult; it is a terrible 
strain to CARRY your characters all that time.  And the difficulty 
of according the narrative and the dialogue (in a work in the third 
person) is extreme.  That is one reason out of half a dozen why I 
so often prefer the first.  It is much in my mind just now, because 
of my last work, just off the stocks three days ago, THE EBB TIDE:  
a dreadful, grimy business in the third person, where the strain 
between a vilely realistic dialogue and a narrative style pitched 
about (in phrase) 'four notes higher' than it should have been, has 
sown my head with grey hairs; or I believe so - if my head escaped, 
my heart has them.
</p><p>The truth is, I have a little lost my way, and stand bemused at the 
cross-roads.  A subject?  Ay, I have dozens; I have at least four 
novels begun, they are none good enough; and the mill waits, and 
I'll have to take second best.  THE EBB TIDE I make the world a 
present of; I expect, and, I suppose, deserve to be torn to pieces; 
but there was all that good work lying useless, and I had to finish 
it!
</p><p>All your news of your family is pleasant to hear.  My wife has been 
very ill, but is now better; I may say I am ditto, THE EBB TIDE 
having left me high and dry, which is a good example of the mixed 
metaphor.  Our home, and estate, and our boys, and the politics of 
the island, keep us perpetually amused and busy; and I grind away 
with an odd, dogged, down sensation - and an idea IN PETTO that the 
game is about played out.  I have got too realistic, and I must 
break the trammels - I mean I would if I could; but the yoke is 
heavy.  I saw with amusement that Zola says the same thing; and 
truly the DEBACLE was a mighty big book, I have no need for a 
bigger, though the last part is a mere mistake in my opinion.  But 
the Emperor, and Sedan, and the doctor at the ambulance, and the 
horses in the field of battle, Lord, how gripped it is!  What an 
epical performance!  According to my usual opinion, I believe I 
could go over that book and leave a masterpiece by blotting and no 
ulterior art.  But that is an old story, ever new with me.  Taine 
gone, and Renan, and Symonds, and Tennyson, and Browning; the suns 
go swiftly out, and I see no suns to follow, nothing but a 
universal twilight of the demi-divinities, with parties like you 
and me and Lang beating on toy drums and playing on penny whistles 
about glow-worms.  But Zola is big anyway; he has plenty in his 
belly; too much, that is all; he wrote the DEBACLE and he wrote LA 
BETE HUMAINE, perhaps the most excruciatingly silly book that I 
ever read to an end.  And why did I read it to an end, W. E. G.?  
Because the animal in me was interested in the lewdness.  Not 
sincerely, of course, my mind refusing to partake in it; but the 
flesh was slightly pleased.  And when it was done, I cast it from 
me with a peal of laughter, and forgot it, as I would forget a 
Montepin.  Taine is to me perhaps the chief of these losses; I did 
luxuriate in his ORIGINES; it was something beyond literature, not 
quite so good, if you please, but so much more systematic, and the 
pages that had to be 'written' always so adequate.  Robespierre, 
Napoleon, were both excellent good.

</p><p>Well, I have left fiction wholly, and gone to my GRANDFATHER, and 
on the whole found peace.  By next month my GRANDFATHER will begin 
to be quite grown up.  I have already three chapters about as good 
as done; by which, of course, as you know, I mean till further 
notice or the next discovery.  I like biography far better than 
fiction myself:  fiction is too free.  In biography you have your 
little handful of facts, little bits of a puzzle, and you sit and 
think, and fit 'em together this way and that, and get up and throw 
'em down, and say damn, and go out for a walk.  And it's real 
soothing; and when done, gives an idea of finish to the writer that 
is very peaceful.  Of course, it's not really so finished as quite 
a rotten novel; it always has and always must have the incurable 
illogicalities of life about it, the fathoms of slack and the miles 
of tedium.  Still, that's where the fun comes in; and when you have 
at last managed to shut up the castle spectre (dulness), the very 
outside of his door looks beautiful by contrast.  There are pages 
in these books that may seem nothing to the reader; but you 
REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN, and 
they seem to you witty beyond comparison.  In my GRANDFATHER I've 
had (for instance) to give up the temporal order almost entirely; 
doubtless the temporal order is the great foe of the biographer; it 
is so tempting, so easy, and lo! there you are in the bog! - Ever 
yours,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>With all kind messages from self and wife to you and yours.  My 
wife is very much better, having been the early part of this year 
alarmingly ill.  She is now all right, only complaining of trifles, 
annoying to her, but happily not interesting to her friends.  I am 
in a hideous state, having stopped drink and smoking; yes, both.  
No wine, no tobacco; and the dreadful part of it is that - looking 
forward - I have - what shall I say? - nauseating intimations that 
it ought to be for ever.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, SAMOAN ISLANDS, JUNE 17TH, 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - I believe I have neglected a mail in 
answering yours.  You will be very sorry to hear that my wife was 
exceedingly ill, and very glad to hear that she is better.  I 
cannot say that I feel any more anxiety about her.  We shall send 
you a photograph of her taken in Sydney in her customary island 
habit as she walks and gardens and shrilly drills her brown 
assistants.  She was very ill when she sat for it, which may a 
little explain the appearance of the photograph.  It reminds me of 
a friend of my grandmother's who used to say when talking to 
younger women, 'Aweel, when I was young, I wasnae just exactly what 
ye wad call BONNY, but I was pale, penetratin', and interestin'.'  
I would not venture to hint that Fanny is 'no bonny,' but there is 
no doubt but that in this presentment she is 'pale, penetratin', 
and interesting.'
</p><p>As you are aware, I have been wading deep waters and contending 
with the great ones of the earth, not wholly without success.  It 
is, you may be interested to hear, a dreary and infuriating 
business.  If you can get the fools to admit one thing, they will 
always save their face by denying another.  If you can induce them 
to take a step to the right hand, they generally indemnify 
themselves by cutting a caper to the left.  I always held (upon no 
evidence whatever, from a mere sentiment or intuition) that 
politics was the dirtiest, the most foolish, and the most random of 
human employments.  I always held, but now I know it!  Fortunately, 
you have nothing to do with anything of the kind, and I may spare 
you the horror of further details.
</p><p>I received from you a book by a man by the name of Anatole France.  
Why should I disguise it?  I have no use for Anatole.  He writes 
very prettily, and then afterwards?  Baron Marbot was a different 
pair of shoes.  So likewise is the Baron de Vitrolles, whom I am 
now perusing with delight.  His escape in 1814 is one of the best 
pages I remember anywhere to have read.  But Marbot and Vitrolles 
are dead, and what has become of the living?  It seems as if 
literature were coming to a stand.  I am sure it is with me; and I 
am sure everybody will say so when they have the privilege of 
reading THE EBB TIDE.  My dear man, the grimness of that story is 
not to be depicted in words.  There are only four characters, to be 
sure, but they are such a troop of swine!  And their behaviour is 
really so deeply beneath any possible standard, that on a 
retrospect I wonder I have been able to endure them myself until 
the yarn was finished.  Well, there is always one thing; it will 
serve as a touchstone.  If the admirers of Zola admire him for his 
pertinent ugliness and pessimism, I think they should admire this; 
but if, as I have long suspected, they neither admire nor 
understand the man's art, and only wallow in his rancidness like a 
hound in offal, then they will certainly be disappointed in THE EBB 
TIDE.  ALAS! poor little tale, it is not EVEN rancid.
</p><p>By way of an antidote or febrifuge, I am going on at a great rate 
with my HISTORY OF THE STEVENSONS, which I hope may prove rather 
amusing, in some parts at least.  The excess of materials weighs 
upon me.  My grandfather is a delightful comedy part; and I have to 
treat him besides as a serious and (in his way) a heroic figure, 
and at times I lose my way, and I fear in the end will blur the 
effect.  However, A LA GRACE DE DIEU!  I'll make a spoon or spoil a 
horn.  You see, I have to do the Building of the Bell Rock by 
cutting down and packing my grandsire's book, which I rather hope I 
have done, but do not know.  And it makes a huge chunk of a very 
different style and quality between Chapters II. and IV.  And it 
can't be helped!  It is just a delightful and exasperating 
necessity.  You know, the stuff is really excellent narrative:  
only, perhaps there's too much of it!  There is the rub.  Well, 
well, it will be plain to you that my mind is affected; it might be 
with less.  THE EBB TIDE and NORTHERN LIGHTS are a full meal for 
any plain man.
</p><p>I have written and ordered your last book, THE REAL THING, so be 
sure and don't send it.  What else are you doing or thinking of 
doing?  News I have none, and don't want any.  I have had to stop 
all strong drink and all tobacco, and am now in a transition state 
between the two, which seems to be near madness.  You never smoked, 
I think, so you can never taste the joys of stopping it.  But at 
least you have drunk, and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance 
when I suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandy-and-water give 
me a splitting headache the next morning.  No mistake about it; 
drink anything, and there's your headache.  Tobacco just as bad for 
me.  If I live through this breach of habit, I shall be a white-
livered puppy indeed.  Actually I am so made, or so twisted, that I 
do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table 
and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire.  It doesn't 
amuse me from a distance.  I may find it the Garden of Eden when I 
go in, but I don't like the colour of the gate-posts.  Suppose 
somebody said to you, you are to leave your home, and your books, 
and your clubs, and go out and camp in mid-Africa, and command an 
expedition, you would howl, and kick, and flee.  I think the same 
of a life without wine and tobacco; and if this goes on, I've got 
to go and do it, sir, in the living flesh!
</p><p>I thought Bourget was a friend of yours?  And I thought the French 
were a polite race?  He has taken my dedication with a stately 
silence that has surprised me into apoplexy.  Did I go and dedicate 
my book to the nasty alien, and the 'norrid Frenchman, and the 
Bloody Furrineer?  Well, I wouldn't do it again; and unless his 
case is susceptible of explanation, you might perhaps tell him so 
over the walnuts and the wine, by way of speeding the gay hours.  
Sincerely, I thought my dedication worth a letter.
</p><p>If anything be worth anything here below!  Do you know the story of 
the man who found a button in his hash, and called the waiter?  
'What do you call that?' says he.  'Well,' said the waiter, 'what 
d'you expect?  Expect to find a gold watch and chain?'  Heavenly 
apologue, is it not?  I expected (rather) to find a gold watch and 
chain; I expected to be able to smoke to excess and drink to 
comfort all the days of my life; and I am still indignantly staring 
on this button!  It's not even a button; it's a teetotal badge! - 
Ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>APIA, JULY 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - Yes.  LES TROPHEES, on the whole, a book.  
It is excellent; but is it a life's work?  I always suspect YOU of 
a volume of sonnets up your sleeve; when is it coming down?  I am 
in one of my moods of wholesale impatience with all fiction and all 
verging on it, reading instead, with rapture, FOUNTAINHALL'S 
DECISIONS.  You never read it:  well, it hasn't much form, and is 
inexpressibly dreary, I should suppose, to others - and even to me 
for pages.  It's like walking in a mine underground, and with a 
damned bad lantern, and picking out pieces of ore.  This, and war, 
will be my excuse for not having read your (doubtless) charming 
work of fiction.  The revolving year will bring me round to it; and 
I know, when fiction shall begin to feel a little SOLID to me 
again, that I shall love it, because it's James.  Do you know, when 
I am in this mood, I would rather try to read a bad book?  It's not 
so disappointing, anyway.  And FOUNTAINHALL is prime, two big folio 
volumes, and all dreary, and all true, and all as terse as an 
obituary; and about one interesting fact on an average in twenty 
pages, and ten of them unintelligible for technicalities.  There's 
literature, if you like!  It feeds; it falls about you genuine like 
rain.  Rain:  nobody has done justice to rain in literature yet:  
surely a subject for a Scot.  But then you can't do rain in that 
ledger-book style that I am trying for - or between a ledger-book 
and an old ballad.  How to get over, how to escape from, the 
besotting PARTICULARITY of fiction.  'Roland approached the house; 
it had green doors and window blinds; and there was a scraper on 
the upper step.'  To hell with Roland and the scraper! - Yours

</p><p>As to ways and means, here is what you will have to do.  Leave San 
Francisco by the down mail, get off at Samoa, and twelve days or a

way.  Make this a FIRST PART OF YOUR PLANS.  A fortnight, even of

<p><b>Letter:  TO A. CONAN DOYLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, AUGUST 23RD, 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. CONAN DOYLE, - I am reposing after a somewhat severe 
experience upon which I think it my duty to report to you.  
Immediately after dinner this evening it occurred to me to re-
narrate to my native overseer Simele your story of THE ENGINEER'S 
THUMB.  And, sir, I have done it.  It was necessary, I need hardly 
say, to go somewhat farther afield than you have done.  To explain 
(for instance) what a railway is, what a steam hammer, what a coach 
and horse, what coining, what a criminal, and what the police.  I 
pass over other and no less necessary explanations.  But I did 
actually succeed; and if you could have seen the drawn, anxious 
features and the bright, feverish eyes of Simele, you would have 
(for the moment at least) tasted glory.  You might perhaps think 
that, were you to come to Samoa, you might be introduced as the 
Author of THE ENGINEER'S THUMB.  Disabuse yourself.  They do not 
know what it is to make up a story.  THE ENGINEER'S THUMB (God 
forgive me) was narrated as a piece of actual and factual history.  
Nay, and more, I who write to you have had the indiscretion to 
perpetrate a trifling piece of fiction entitled THE BOTTLE IMP.  
Parties who come up to visit my unpretentious mansion, after having 
admired the ceilings by Vanderputty and the tapestry by Gobbling, 
manifest towards the end a certain uneasiness which proves them to 
be fellows of an infinite delicacy.  They may be seen to shrug a 
brown shoulder, to roll up a speaking eye, and at last secret 
bursts from them:  'Where is the bottle?'  Alas, my friends (I feel 
tempted to say), you will find it by the Engineer's Thumb!  Talofa-
soifuia.
</p><p>Oa'u, O lau no moni, O Tusitala.
</p><p>More commonly known as,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>Have read the REFUGEES; Conde and old P.  Murat very good; Louis 
XIV. and Louvois with the letter bag very rich.  You have reached a 
trifle wide perhaps; too MANY celebrities?  Though I was delighted 
to re-encounter my old friend Du Chaylu.  Old Murat is perhaps your 
high water mark; 'tis excellently human, cheerful and real.  Do it 
again.  Madame de Maintenon struck me as quite good.  Have you any 
document for the decapitation?  It sounds steepish.  The devil of 
all that first part is that you see old Dumas; yet your Louis XIV. 
is DISTINCTLY GOOD.  I am much interested with this book, which 
fulfils a good deal, and promises more.  Question:  How far a 
Historical Novel should be wholly episodic?  I incline to that 
view, with trembling.  I shake hands with you on old Murat.

<p><b>Letter:  TO GEORGE MEREDITH</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SEPT. 5TH, 1893, VAILIMA PLANTATION, UPOLU, SAMOA.
</p><p>MY DEAR MEREDITH, - I have again and again taken up the pen to 
write to you, and many beginnings have gone into the waste paper 
basket (I have one now - for the second time in my life - and feel 
a big man on the strength of it).  And no doubt it requires some 
decision to break so long a silence.  My health is vastly restored, 
and I am now living patriarchally in this place six hundred feet 
above the sea on the shoulder of a mountain of 1500.  Behind me, 
the unbroken bush slopes up to the backbone of the island (3 to 
4000) without a house, with no inhabitants save a few runaway black 
boys, wild pigs and cattle, and wild doves and flying foxes, and 
many parti-coloured birds, and many black, and many white:  a very 
eerie, dim, strange place and hard to travel.  I am the head of a 
household of five whites, and of twelve Samoans, to all of whom I 
am the chief and father:  my cook comes to me and asks leave to 
marry - and his mother, a fine old chief woman, who has never lived 
here, does the same.  You may be sure I granted the petition.  It 
is a life of great interest, complicated by the Tower of Babel, 
that old enemy.  And I have all the time on my hands for literary 
work.  My house is a great place; we have a hall fifty feet long 
with a great red-wood stair ascending from it, where we dine in 
state - myself usually dressed in a singlet and a pair of trousers 
- and attended on by servants in a single garment, a kind of kilt - 
also flowers and leaves - and their hair often powdered with lime.  
The European who came upon it suddenly would think it was a dream.  
We have prayers on Sunday night - I am a perfect pariah in the 
island not to have them oftener, but the spirit is unwilling and 
the flesh proud, and I cannot go it more.  It is strange to see the 
long line of the brown folk crouched along the wall with lanterns 
at intervals before them in the big shadowy hall, with an oak 
cabinet at one end of it and a group of Rodin's (which native taste 
regards as PRODIGIEUSEMENT LESTE) presiding over all from the top - 
and to hear the long rambling Samoan hymn rolling up (God bless me, 
what style!  But I am off business to-day, and this is not meant to 
be literature.).
</p><p>I have asked Colvin to send you a copy of CATRIONA, which I am 
sometimes tempted to think is about my best work.  I hear word 
occasionally of the AMAZING MARRIAGE.  It will be a brave day for 
me when I get hold of it.  Gower Woodseer is now an ancient, lean, 
grim, exiled Scot, living and labouring as for a wager in the 
tropics; still active, still with lots of fire in him, but the 
youth - ah, the youth where is it?  For years after I came here, 
the critics (those genial gentlemen) used to deplore the relaxation 
of my fibre and the idleness to which I had succumbed.  I hear less 
of this now; the next thing is they will tell me I am writing 
myself out! and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their 
grey hairs with sorrow to the dust.  I do not know - I mean I do 
know one thing.  For fourteen years I have not had a day's real 
health; I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary; and I have done 
my work unflinchingly.  I have written in bed, and written out of 
it, written in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn by 
coughing, written when my head swam for weakness; and for so long, 
it seems to me I have won my wager and recovered my glove.  I am 
better now, have been rightly speaking since first I came to the 
Pacific; and still, few are the days when I am not in some physical 
distress.  And the battle goes on - ill or well, is a trifle; so as 
it goes.  I was made for a contest, and the Powers have so willed 
that my battlefield should be this dingy, inglorious one of the bed 
and the physic bottle.  At least I have not failed, but I would 
have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my 
head.
</p><p>This is a devilish egotistical yarn.  Will you try to imitate me in 
that if the spirit ever moves you to reply?  And meantime be sure 
that away in the midst of the Pacific there is a house on a wooded 
island where the name of George Meredith is very dear, and his 
memory (since it must be no more) is continually honoured. - Ever 
your friend,

</p><p>VAILIMA, SEPTEMBER 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS, - I had determined not to write to you till I 
had seen the medallion, but it looks as if that might mean the 
Greek Kalends or the day after to-morrow.  Reassure yourself, your 
part is done, it is ours that halts - the consideration of 
conveyance over our sweet little road on boys' backs, for we cannot 
very well apply the horses to this work; there is only one; you 
cannot put it in a panier; to put it on the horse's back we have 
not the heart.  Beneath the beauty of R. L. S., to say nothing of 
his verses, which the publishers find heavy enough, and the genius 
of the god-like sculptor, the spine would snap and the well-knit 
limbs of the (ahem) cart-horse would be loosed by death.  So you 
are to conceive me, sitting in my house, dubitative, and the 
medallion chuckling in the warehouse of the German firm, for some 
days longer; and hear me meanwhile on the golden letters.
</p><p>Alas! they are all my fancy painted, but the price is prohibitive.  
I cannot do it.  It is another day-dream burst.  Another gable of 
Abbotsford has gone down, fortunately before it was builded, so 
there's nobody injured - except me.  I had a strong conviction that 
I was a great hand at writing inscriptions, and meant to exhibit 
and test my genius on the walls of my house; and now I see I can't.  
It is generally thus.  The Battle of the Golden Letters will never 
be delivered.  On making preparation to open the campaign, the King 
found himself face to face with invincible difficulties, in which 
the rapacity of a mercenary soldiery and the complaints of an 
impoverished treasury played an equal part. - Ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I enclose a bill for the medallion; have been trying to find your 
letter, quite in vain, and therefore must request you to pay for 
the bronze letters yourself and let me know the damage.

</p><p>MY DEAR STEVENSON, - A thousand thanks for your voluminous and 
delightful collections.  Baxter - so soon as it is ready - will let 
you see a proof of my introduction, which is only sent out as a 
sprat to catch whales.  And you will find I have a good deal of 
what you have, only mine in a perfectly desultory manner, as is 
necessary to an exile.  My uncle's pedigree is wrong; there was 
never a Stevenson of Caldwell, of course, but they were tenants of 
the Muirs; the farm held by them is in my introduction; and I have 
already written to Charles Baxter to have a search made in the 
Register House.  I hope he will have had the inspiration to put it 
under your surveillance.  Your information as to your own family is 
intensely interesting, and I should not wonder but what you and we 
and old John Stevenson, 'land labourer in the parish of Dailly,' 
came all of the same stock.  Ayrshire - and probably Cunningham - 
seems to be the home of the race - our part of it.  From the 
distribution of the name - which your collections have so much 
extended without essentially changing my knowledge of - we seem 
rather pointed to a British origin.  What you say of the Engineers 
is fresh to me, and must be well thrashed out.  This introduction 
of it will take a long while to walk about! - as perhaps I may be 
tempted to let it become long; after all, I am writing THIS for my 
own pleasure solely.  Greetings to you and other Speculatives of 
our date, long bygone, alas! - Yours very sincerely,

thing for her.  We are in that part of the year which I like the 
best - the Rainy or Hurricane Season.  'When it is good, it is 
very, very good; and when it is bad, it is horrid,' and our fine 
days are certainly fine like heaven; such a blue of the sea, such 
green of the trees, and such crimson of the hibiscus flowers, you 
never saw; and the air as mild and gentle as a baby's breath, and 
yet not hot!

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>

</p><p>6TH DECEMBER 1893.
</p><p>'OCTOBER 25, 1685. - At Privy Council, George Murray, Lieutenant of 
the King's Guard, and others, did, on the 21st of September last, 
obtain a clandestine order of Privy Council to apprehend the person 
of Janet Pringle, daughter to the late Clifton, and she having 
retired out of the way upon information, he got an order against 
Andrew Pringle, her uncle, to produce her. . . . But she having 
married Andrew Pringle, her uncle's son (to disappoint all their 
designs of selling her), a boy of thirteen years old.'  But my boy 
is to be fourteen, so I extract no further. - FOUNTAINHALL, i. 320.
</p><p>'MAY 6, 1685. - Wappus Pringle of Clifton was still alive after 
all, and in prison for debt, and transacts with Lieutenant Murray, 
giving security for 7000 marks.' - i. 372.
</p><p>No, it seems to have been HER brother who had succeeded.
</p><p><br />
MY DEAR CHARLES, - The above is my story, and I wonder if any light 
can be thrown on it.  I prefer the girl's father dead; and the 
question is, How in that case could Lieutenant George Murray get 
his order to 'apprehend' and his power to 'sell' her in marriage?
</p><p>Or - might Lieutenant G. be her tutor, and she fugitive to the 
Pringles, and on the discovery of her whereabouts hastily married?
</p><p>A good legal note on these points is very ardently desired by me; 
it will be the corner-stone of my novel.
</p><p>This is for - I am quite wrong to tell you - for you will tell 
others - and nothing will teach you that all my schemes are in the 
air, and vanish and reappear again like shapes in the clouds - it 
is for HEATHERCAT:  whereof the first volume will be called THE 
KILLING TIME, and I believe I have authorities ample for that.  But 
the second volume is to be called (I believe) DARIEN, and for that 
I want, I fear, a good deal of truck:-
</p><p><br />
DARIEN PAPERS,
CARSTAIRS PAPERS,
MARCHMONT PAPERS,
JERVISWOODE CORRESPONDENCE,
</p><p><br />
I hope may do me.  Some sort of general history of the Darien 
affair (if there is a decent one, which I misdoubt), it would also 
be well to have - the one with most details, if possible.  It is 
singular how obscure to me this decade of Scots history remains, 
1690-1700 - a deuce of a want of light and grouping to it!  
However, I believe I shall be mostly out of Scotland in my tale; 
first in Carolina, next in Darien.  I want also - I am the daughter 
of the horse-leech truly - 'Black's new large map of Scotland,' 
sheets 3, 4, and 5, a 7s. 6d. touch.  I believe, if you can get the
</p><p><br />
CALDWELL PAPERS,
</p><p><br />
they had better come also; and if there be any reasonable work - 
but no, I must call a halt. . . .
</p><p>I fear the song looks doubtful, but I'll consider of it, and I can 
promise you some reminiscences which it will amuse me to write, 
whether or not it will amuse the public to read of them.  But it's 
an unco business to SUPPLY deid-heid coapy.

<p><b>Letter:  TO J. M. BARRIE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 7TH, 1893.
</p><p>MY DEAR BARRIE, - I have received duly the MAGNUM OPUS, and it 
really is a MAGNUM OPUS.  It is a beautiful specimen of Clark's 
printing, paper sufficient, and the illustrations all my fancy 
painted.  But the particular flower of the flock to whom I have 
hopelessly lost my heart is Tibby Birse.  I must have known Tibby 
Birse when she was a servant's mantua-maker in Edinburgh and 
answered to the name of Miss BRODDIE.  She used to come and sew 
with my nurse, sitting with her legs crossed in a masculine manner; 
and swinging her foot emphatically, she used to pour forth a 
perfectly unbroken stream of gossip.  I didn't hear it, I was 
immersed in far more important business with a box of bricks, but 
the recollection of that thin, perpetual, shrill sound of a voice 
has echoed in my ears sinsyne.  I am bound to say she was younger 
than Tibbie, but there is no mistaking that and the indescribable 
and eminently Scottish expression.
</p><p>I have been very much prevented of late, having carried out 
thoroughly to my own satisfaction two considerable illnesses, had a 
birthday, and visited Honolulu, where politics are (if possible) a 
shade more exasperating than they are with us.  I am told that it 
was just when I was on the point of leaving that I received your 
superlative epistle about the cricket eleven.  In that case it is 
impossible I should have answered it, which is inconsistent with my 
own recollection of the fact.  What I remember is, that I sat down 
under your immediate inspiration and wrote an answer in every way 
worthy.  If I didn't, as it seems proved that I couldn't, it will 
never be done now.  However, I did the next best thing, I equipped 
my cousin Graham Balfour with a letter of introduction, and from 
him, if you know how - for he is rather of the Scottish character - 
you may elicit all the information you can possibly wish to have as 
to us and ours.  Do not be bluffed off by the somewhat stern and 
monumental first impression that he may make upon you.  He is one 
of the best fellows in the world, and the same sort of fool that we 
are, only better-looking, with all the faults of Vailimans and some 
of his own - I say nothing about virtues.
</p><p>I have lately been returning to my wallowing in the mire.  When I 
was a child, and indeed until I was nearly a man, I consistently 
read Covenanting books.  Now that I am a grey-beard - or would be, 
if I could raise the beard - I have returned, and for weeks back 
have read little else but Wodrow, Walker, Shields, etc.  Of course 
this is with an idea of a novel, but in the course of it I made a 
very curious discovery.  I have been accustomed to hear refined and 
intelligent critics - those who know so much better what we are 
than we do ourselves, - trace down my literary descent from all 
sorts of people, including Addison, of whom I could never read a 
word.  Well, laigh i' your lug, sir - the clue was found.  My style 
is from the Covenanting writers.  Take a particular case - the 
fondness for rhymes.  I don't know of any English prose-writer who 
rhymes except by accident, and then a stone had better be tied 
around his neck and himself cast into the sea.  But my Covenanting 
buckies rhyme all the time - a beautiful example of the unconscious 
rhyme above referred to.
</p><p>Do you know, and have you really tasted, these delightful works?  
If not, it should be remedied; there is enough of the Auld Licht in 
you to be ravished.
</p><p>I suppose you know that success has so far attended my banners - my 
political banners I mean, and not my literary.  In conjunction with 
the Three Great Powers I have succeeded in getting rid of My 
President and My Chief-Justice.  They've gone home, the one to 
Germany, the other to Souwegia.  I hear little echoes of footfalls 
of their departing footsteps through the medium of the newspapers. 
. . .
</p><p>Whereupon I make you my salute with the firm remark that it is time 
to be done with trifling and give us a great book, and my ladies 
fall into line with me to pay you a most respectful courtesy, and 
we all join in the cry, 'Come to Vailima!'
</p><p>My dear sir, your soul's health is in it - you will never do the 
great book, you will never cease to work in L., etc., till you come 
to Vailima.
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO R. LE GALLIENNE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 28TH, 1893.
</p><p>DEAR MR. LE GALLIENNE, - I have received some time ago, through our 
friend Miss Taylor, a book of yours.  But that was by no means my 
first introduction to your name.  The same book had stood already 
on my shelves; I had read articles of yours in the ACADEMY; and by 
a piece of constructive criticism (which I trust was sound) had 
arrived at the conclusion that you were 'Log-roller.'  Since then I 
have seen your beautiful verses to your wife.  You are to conceive 
me, then, as only too ready to make the acquaintance of a man who 
loved good literature and could make it.  I had to thank you, 
besides, for a triumphant exposure of a paradox of my own:  the 
literary-prostitute disappeared from view at a phrase of yours - 
'The essence is not in the pleasure but the sale.'  True:  you are 
right, I was wrong; the author is not the whore, but the libertine; 
and yet I shall let the passage stand.  It is an error, but it 
illustrated the truth for which I was contending, that literature - 
painting - all art, are no other than pleasures, which we turn into 
trades.
</p><p>And more than all this, I had, and I have to thank you for the 
intimate loyalty you have shown to myself; for the eager welcome 
you give to what is good - for the courtly tenderness with which 
you touch on my defects.  I begin to grow old; I have given my top 
note, I fancy; - and I have written too many books.  The world 
begins to be weary of the old booth; and if not weary, familiar 
with the familiarity that breeds contempt.  I do not know that I am 
sensitive to criticism, if it be hostile; I am sensitive indeed, 
when it is friendly; and when I read such criticism as yours, I am 
emboldened to go on and praise God.
</p><p>You are still young, and you may live to do much.  The little, 
artificial popularity of style in England tends, I think, to die 
out; the British pig returns to his true love, the love of the 
styleless, of the shapeless, of the slapdash and the disorderly.  
There is trouble coming, I think; and you may have to hold the fort 
for us in evil days.
</p><p>Lastly, let me apologise for the crucifixion that I am inflicting 
on you (BIEN A CONTRE-COEUR) by my bad writing.  I was once the 
best of writers; landladies, puzzled as to my 'trade,' used to have 
their honest bosoms set at rest by a sight of a page of manuscript. 
- 'Ah,' they would say, 'no wonder they pay you for that'; - and 
when I sent it in to the printers, it was given to the boys!  I was 
about thirty-nine, I think, when I had a turn of scrivener's palsy; 
my hand got worse; and for the first time, I received clean proofs.  
But it has gone beyond that now, I know I am like my old friend 
James Payn, a terror to correspondents; and you would not believe 
the care with which this has been written. - Believe me to be, very 
sincerely yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

As it is, I fear I am only going to put you to trouble and 
vexation.  This Braille writing is a kind of consecration, and I 
would like if I could to have your copy perfect.  The two volumes 
are to be published as Vols. I. and II. of THE ADVENTURES OF DAVID 
BALFOUR.  1st, KIDNAPPED; 2nd, CATRIONA.  I am just sending home a 
corrected KIDNAPPED for this purpose to Messrs. Cassell, and in 
order that I may if possible be in time, I send it to you first of 
all.  Please, as soon as you have noted the changes, forward the 
same to Cassell and Co., La Belle Sauvage Yard, Ludgate Hill.
</p><p>I am writing to them by this mail to send you CATRIONA.
</p><p>You say, dear madam, you are good enough to say, it is 'a keen

</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - The mail has come upon me like an armed man 
three days earlier than was expected; and the Lord help me!  It is 
impossible I should answer anybody the way they should be.  Your 
jubilation over CATRIONA did me good, and still more the subtlety 
and truth of your remark on the starving of the visual sense in 
that book.  'Tis true, and unless I make the greater effort - and 
am, as a step to that, convinced of its necessity - it will be more 
true I fear in the future.  I HEAR people talking, and I FEEL them 
acting, and that seems to me to be fiction.  My two aims may be 
described as -
</p><p>1ST.  War to the adjective.
2ND.  Death to the optic nerve.
</p><p>Admitted we live in an age of the optic nerve in literature.  For 
how many centuries did literature get along without a sign of it?  
However, I'll consider your letter.
</p><p>How exquisite is your character of the critic in ESSAYS IN LONDON!  
I doubt if you have done any single thing so satisfying as a piece 
of style and of insight. - Yours ever,

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>1ST JANUARY '94.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - I am delighted with your idea, and first, I will 
here give an amended plan and afterwards give you a note of some of 
the difficulties.
</p><p>[Plan of the Edinburgh edition - 14 vols.]
</p><p>. . . It may be a question whether my TIMES letters might not be 
appended to the 'Footnote' with a note of the dates of discharge of 
Cedercrantz and Pilsach.
</p><p>I am particularly pleased with this idea of yours, because I am 
come to a dead stop.  I never can remember how bad I have been 
before, but at any rate I am bad enough just now, I mean as to 
literature; in health I am well and strong.  I take it I shall be 
six months before I'm heard of again, and this time I could put in 
to some advantage in revising the text and (if it were thought 
desirable) writing prefaces.  I do not know how many of them might 
be thought desirable.  I have written a paper on TREASURE ISLAND, 
which is to appear shortly.  MASTER OF BALLANTRAE - I have one 
drafted.  THE WRECKER is quite sufficiently done already with the 
last chapter, but I suppose an historic introduction to DAVID 
BALFOUR is quite unavoidable.  PRINCE OTTO I don't think I could 
say anything about, and BLACK ARROW don't want to.  But it is 
probable I could say something to the volume of TRAVELS.  In the 
verse business I can do just what I like better than anything else, 
and extend UNDERWOODS with a lot of unpublished stuff.  APROPOS, if 
I were to get printed off a very few poems which are somewhat too 
intimate for the public, could you get them run up in some luxuous 
manner, so that fools might be induced to buy them in just a 
sufficient quantity to pay expenses and the thing remain still in a 
manner private?  We could supply photographs of the illustrations - 
and the poems are of Vailima and the family - I should much like to 
get this done as a surprise for Fanny.

<p><b>Letter:  TO H. B. BAILDON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JANUARY 15TH, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR BAILDON, - Last mail brought your book and its Dedication.  
'Frederick Street and the gardens, and the short-lived Jack o' 
Lantern,' are again with me - and the note of the east wind, and 
Froebel's voice, and the smell of soup in Thomson's stair.  Truly, 
you had no need to put yourself under the protection of any other 
saint, were that saint our Tamate himself!  Yourself were enough, 
and yourself coming with so rich a sheaf.
</p><p>For what is this that you say about the Muses?  They have certainly 
never better inspired you than in 'Jael and Sisera,' and 'Herodias 
and John the Baptist,' good stout poems, fiery and sound.  <i>Tis </i>
but a mask and behind it chuckles the God of the Garden,' I shall 
never forget.  By the by, an error of the press, page 49, line 4, 
'No infant's lesson are the ways of God.'  THE is dropped.
</p><p>And this reminds me you have a bad habit which is to be comminated 
in my theory of letters.  Same page, two lines lower:  'But the 
vulture's track' is surely as fine to the ear as 'But vulture's 
track,' and this latter version has a dreadful baldness.  The 
reader goes on with a sense of impoverishment, of unnecessary 
sacrifice; he has been robbed by footpads, and goes scouting for 
his lost article!  Again, in the second Epode, these fine verses 
would surely sound much finer if they began, 'As a hardy climber 
who has set his heart,' than with the jejune 'As hardy climber.'  I 
do not know why you permit yourself this license with grammar; you 
show, in so many pages, that you are superior to the paltry sense 
of rhythm which usually dictates it - as though some poetaster had 
been suffered to correct the poet's text.  By the way, I confess to 
a heartfelt weakness for AURICULAS. - Believe me the very grateful 
and characteristic pick-thank, but still sincere and affectionate,

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW.</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JANUARY 15th, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - . . . Pray you, stoop your proud head, and sell 
yourself to some Jew magazine, and make the visit out.  I assure 
you, this is the spot for a sculptor or painter.  This, and no 
other - I don't say to stay there, but to come once and get the 
living colour into them.  I am used to it; I do not notice it; 
rather prefer my grey, freezing recollections of Scotland; but 
there it is, and every morning is a thing to give thanks for, and 
every night another - bar when it rains, of course.
</p><p>About THE WRECKER - rather late days, and I still suspect I had 
somehow offended you; however, all's well that ends well, and I am 
glad I am forgiven - did you not fail to appreciate the attitude of 
Dodd?  He was a fizzle and a stick, he knew it, he knew nothing 
else, and there is an undercurrent of bitterness in him.  And then 
the problem that Pinkerton laid down:  why the artist can DO 
NOTHING ELSE? is one that continually exercises myself.  He cannot:  
granted.  But Scott could.  And Montaigne.  And Julius Caesar.  And 
many more.  And why can't R. L. S.?  Does it not amaze you?  It 
does me.  I think of the Renaissance fellows, and their all-round 
human sufficiency, and compare it with the ineffable smallness of 
the field in which we labour and in which we do so little.  I think 
DAVID BALFOUR a nice little book, and very artistic, and just the 
thing to occupy the leisure of a busy man; but for the top flower 
of a man's life it seems to me inadequate.  Small is the word; it 
is a small age, and I am of it.  I could have wished to be 
otherwise busy in this world.  I ought to have been able to build 
lighthouses and write DAVID BALFOURS too.  HINC ILLAE LACRYMAE.  I 
take my own case as most handy, but it is as illustrative of my 
quarrel with the age.  We take all these pains, and we don't do as 
well as Michael Angelo or Leonardo, or even Fielding, who was an 
active magistrate, or Richardson, who was a busy bookseller.  J'AI 
HONTE POUR NOUS; my ears burn.
</p><p>I am amazed at the effect which this Chicago exhibition has 
produced upon you and others.  It set Mrs. Fairchild literally mad 
- to judge by her letters.  And I wish I had seen anything so 
influential.  I suppose there was an aura, a halo, some sort of 
effulgency about the place; for here I find you louder than the 
rest.  Well, it may be there is a time coming; and I wonder, when 
it comes, whether it will be a time of little, exclusive, one-eyed 
rascals like you and me, or parties of the old stamp who can paint 
and fight, and write and keep books of double entry, and sculp, and 
scalp.  It might be.  You have a lot of stuff in the kettle, and a 
great deal of it Celtic.  I have changed my mind progressively 
about England, practically the whole of Scotland is Celtic, and the 
western half of England, and all Ireland, and the Celtic blood 
makes a rare blend for art.  If it is stiffened up with Latin 
blood, you get the French.  We were less lucky:  we had only 
Scandinavians, themselves decidedly artistic, and the Low-German 
lot.  However, that is a good starting-point, and with all the 
other elements in your crucible, it may come to something great 
very easily.  I wish you would hurry up and let me see it.  Here is 
a long while I have been waiting for something GOOD in art; and 
what have I seen?  Zola's DEBACLE and a few of Kipling's tales.  
Are you a reader of Barbey d'Aurevilly?  He is a never-failing 
source of pleasure to me, for my sins, I suppose.  What a work is 
the RIDEAU CRAMOISI! and L'ENSORCELEE! and LE CHEVALIER DES 
TOUCHES!
</p><p>This is degenerating into mere twaddle.  So please remember us all 
most kindly to Mrs. Low, and believe me ever yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - Were all your privateers voiceless in the war of 1812?  Did 
NO ONE of them write memoirs?  I shall have to do my privateer from 
chic, if you can't help me.  My application to Scribner has been 
quite in vain.  See if you can get hold of some historic sharp in 
the club, and tap him; they must some of them have written memoirs 
or notes of some sort; perhaps still unprinted; if that be so, get 
them copied for me.

now, or say in half a year, I should have had a splendid time of it 
on the whole.  But it gets a little stale, and my work will begin 
to senesce; and parties to shy bricks at me; and now it begins to 
look as if I should survive to see myself impotent and forgotten.  
It's a pity suicide is not thought the ticket in the best circles.
</p><p>But your letter goes on to congratulate me on having done the one 
thing I am a little sorry for; a little - not much - for my father 
himself lived to think that I had been wiser than he.  But the 
cream of the jest is that I have lived to change my mind; and think 
that he was wiser than I.  Had I been an engineer, and literature 
my amusement, it would have been better perhaps.  I pulled it off, 
of course, I won the wager, and it is pleasant while it lasts; but 
how long will it last?  I don't know, say the Bells of Old Bow.

</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, MARCH 27TH, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR ARCHER, - Many thanks for your THEATRICAL WORLD.  Do you 
know, it strikes me as being really very good?  I have not yet read 
much of it, but so far as I have looked, there is not a dull and 
not an empty page in it.  Hazlitt, whom you must often have thought 
of, would have been pleased.  Come to think of it, I shall put this 
book upon the Hazlitt shelf.  You have acquired a manner that I can 
only call august; otherwise, I should have to call it such amazing 
impudence.  The BAUBLE SHOP and BECKET are examples of what I mean.  
But it 'sets you weel.'
</p><p>Marjorie Fleming I have known, as you surmise, for long.  She was 
possibly - no, I take back possibly - she was one of the greatest 
works of God.  Your note about the resemblance of her verses to 
mine gave me great joy, though it only proved me a plagiarist.  By 
the by, was it not over THE CHILD'S GARDEN OF VERSES that we first 
scraped acquaintance?  I am sorry indeed to hear that my esteemed 
correspondent Tomarcher has such poor taste in literature.  I fear 
he cannot have inherited this trait from his dear papa.  Indeed, I 
may say I know it, for I remember the energy of papa's disapproval 
when the work passed through his hands on its way to a second 
birth, which none regrets more than myself.  It is an odd fact, or 
perhaps a very natural one; I find few greater pleasures than 
reading my own works, but I never, O I never read THE BLACK ARROW.  
In that country Tomarcher reigns supreme.  Well, and after all, if 
Tomarcher likes it, it has not been written in vain.
</p><p>We have just now a curious breath from Europe.  A young fellow just 
beginning letters, and no fool, turned up here with a letter of

of George Meredith.  His name may be known to you.  It is Sidney 
Lysaght.  He is staying with us but a day or two, and it is strange 
to me and not unpleasant to hear all the names, old and new, come 
up again.  But oddly the new are so much more in number.  If I 
revisited the glimpses of the moon on your side of the ocean, I 
should know comparatively few of them.
</p><p>My amanuensis deserts me - I should have said you, for yours is the 
loss, my script having lost all bond with humanity.  One touch of 
nature makes the whole world kin:  that nobody can read my hand.  
It is a humiliating circumstance that thus evens us with printers!
</p><p>You must sometimes think it strange - or perhaps it is only I that 
should so think it - to be following the old round, in the gas 
lamps and the crowded theatres, when I am away here in the tropical 
forest and the vast silences!
</p><p>My dear Archer, my wife joins me in the best wishes to yourself and 
Mrs. Archer, not forgetting Tom; and I am yours very cordially,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. B. YEATS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, APRIL 14, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR SIR, - Long since when I was a boy I remember the emotions 
with which I repeated Swinburne's poems and ballads.  Some ten 
years ago, a similar spell was cast upon me by Meredith's LOVE IN 
THE VALLEY; the stanzas beginning 'When her mother tends her' 
haunted me and made me drunk like wine; and I remember waking with 
them all the echoes of the hills about Hyeres.  It may interest you 
to hear that I have a third time fallen in slavery:  this is to 
your poem called the LAKE ISLE OF INNISFRAE.  It is so quaint and 
airy, simple, artful, and eloquent to the heart - but I seek words 
in vain.  Enough that 'always night and day I hear lake water 
lapping with low sounds on the shore,' and am, yours gratefully,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO GEORGE MEREDITH</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, APRIL 17TH, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR MEREDITH, - Many good things have the gods sent to me of 
late.  First of all there was a letter from you by the kind hand of 
Mariette, if she is not too great a lady to be remembered in such a 
style; and then there came one Lysaght with a charming note of 
introduction in the well-known hand itself.  We had but a few days 
of him, and liked him well.  There was a sort of geniality and 
inward fire about him at which I warmed my hands.  It is long since 
I have seen a young man who has left in me such a favourable 
impression; and I find myself telling myself, 'O, I must tell this 
to Lysaght,' or, 'This will interest him,' in a manner very unusual 
after so brief an acquaintance.  The whole of my family shared in 
this favourable impression, and my halls have re-echoed ever since, 
I am sure he will be amused to know, with WIDDICOMBE FAIR.
</p><p>He will have told you doubtless more of my news than I could tell 
you myself; he has your European perspective, a thing long lost to 
me.  I heard with a great deal of interest the news of Box Hill.  
And so I understand it is to be enclosed!  Allow me to remark, that 
seems a far more barbaric trait of manners than the most barbarous 
of ours.  We content ourselves with cutting off an occasional head.
</p><p>I hear we may soon expect the AMAZING MARRIAGE.  You know how long, 
and with how much curiosity, I have looked forward to the book.  
Now, in so far as you have adhered to your intention, Gower 
Woodsere will be a family portrait, age twenty-five, of the highly 
respectable and slightly influential and fairly aged TUSITALA.  You 
have not known that gentleman; console yourself, he is not worth 
knowing.  At the same time, my dear Meredith, he is very sincerely 
yours - for what he is worth, for the memories of old times, and in 
the expectation of many pleasures still to come.  I suppose we 
shall never see each other again; flitting youths of the Lysaght 
species may occasionally cover these unconscionable leagues and 
bear greetings to and fro.  But we ourselves must be content to 
converse on an occasional sheet of notepaper, and I shall never see 
whether you have grown older, and you shall never deplore that 
Gower Woodsere should have declined into the pantaloon TUSITALA.  
It is perhaps better so.  Let us continue to see each other as we 
were, and accept, my dear Meredith, my love and respect.
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - My wife joins me in the kindest messages to yourself and 
Mariette.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>

</p><p>[VAILIMA], APRIL 17, '94.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - ST. IVES is now well on its way into the second 
volume.  There remains no mortal doubt that it will reach the three 
volume standard.
</p><p>I am very anxious that you should send me -
</p><p>1ST.  TOM AND JERRY, a cheap edition.
</p><p>2nd.  The book by Ashton - the DAWN OF THE CENTURY, I think it was 
called - which Colvin sent me, and which has miscarried, and
</p><p>3rd.  If it is possible, a file of the EDINBURGH COURANT for the 
years 1811, 1812, 1813, or 1814.  I should not care for a whole 
year.  If it were possible to find me three months, winter months 
by preference, it would do my business not only for ST. IVES, but 
for the JUSTICE-CLERK as well.  Suppose this to be impossible, 
perhaps I could get the loan of it from somebody; or perhaps it 
would be possible to have some one read a file for me and make 
notes.  This would be extremely bad, as unhappily one man's food is 
another man's poison, and the reader would probably leave out 
everything I should choose.  But if you are reduced to that, you 
might mention to the man who is to read for me that balloon 
ascensions are in the order of the day.
</p><p>4th.  It might be as well to get a book on balloon ascension, 
particularly in the early part of the century.
</p><p>. . . . .
</p><p>III.  At last this book has come from Scribner, and, alas!  I have 
the first six or seven chapters of ST. IVES to recast entirely.  
Who could foresee that they clothed the French prisoners in yellow?  
But that one fatal fact - and also that they shaved them twice a 
week - damns the whole beginning.  If it had been sent in time, it 
would have saved me a deal of trouble. . . .
</p><p>I have had a long letter from Dr. Scott Dalgleish, 25 Mayfield 
Terrace, asking me to put my name down to the Ballantyne Memorial 
Committee.  I have sent him a pretty sharp answer in favour of 
cutting down the memorial and giving more to the widow and 
children.  If there is to be any foolery in the way of statues or 
other trash, please send them a guinea; but if they are going to 
take my advice and put up a simple tablet with a few heartfelt 
words, and really devote the bulk of the subscriptions to the wife 
and family, I will go to the length of twenty pounds, if you will 
allow me (and if the case of the family be at all urgent), and at 
least I direct you to send ten pounds.  I suppose you had better 
see Scott Dalgleish himself on the matter.  I take the opportunity 
here to warn you that my head is simply spinning with a multitude 
of affairs, and I shall probably forget a half of my business at 
last.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. SITWELL</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, APRIL 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR FRIEND, - I have at last got some photographs, and hasten 
to send you, as you asked, a portrait of Tusitala.  He is a strange 
person; not so lean, say experts, but infinitely battered; mighty 
active again on the whole; going up and down our break-neck road at 
all hours of the day and night on horseback; holding meetings with 
all manner of chiefs; quite a political personage - God save the 
mark! - in a small way, but at heart very conscious of the 
inevitable flat failure that awaits every one.  I shall never do a 
better book than CATRIONA, that is my high-water mark, and the 
trouble of production increases on me at a great rate - and mighty 
anxious about how I am to leave my family:  an elderly man, with 
elderly preoccupations, whom I should be ashamed to show you for 
your old friend; but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly, and 
'winning off the stage.'  Rather I am daily better in physical 
health.  I shall have to see this business out, after all; and I 
think, in that case, they should have - they might have - spared me 
all my ill-health this decade past, if it were not to unbar the 
doors.  I have no taste for old age, and my nose is to be rubbed in 
it in spite of my face.  I was meant to die young, and the gods do 
not love me.
</p><p>This is very like an epitaph, bar the handwriting, which is 
anything but monumental, and I dare say I had better stop.  Fanny 
is down at her own cottage planting or deplanting or replanting, I 
know not which, and she will not be home till dinner, by which time 
the mail will be all closed, else she would join me in all good 
messages and remembrances of love.  I hope you will congratulate 
Burne Jones from me on his baronetcy.  I cannot make out to be 
anything but raspingly, harrowingly sad; so I will close, and not 
affect levity which I cannot feel.  Do not altogether forget me; 
keep a corner of your memory for the exile

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, MAY 1894.]
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - My dear fellow, I wish to assure you of the 
greatness of the pleasure that this Edinburgh Edition gives me.  I 
suppose it was your idea to give it that name.  No other would have 
affected me in the same manner.  Do you remember, how many years 
ago - I would be afraid to hazard a guess - one night when I 
communicated to you certain intimations of early death and 
aspirations after fame?  I was particularly maudlin; and my remorse 
the next morning on a review of my folly has written the matter 
very deeply in my mind; from yours it may easily have fled.  If any 
one at that moment could have shown me the Edinburgh Edition, I 
suppose I should have died.  It is with gratitude and wonder that I 
consider 'the way in which I have been led.'  Could a more 
preposterous idea have occurred to us in those days when we used to 
search our pockets for coppers, too often in vain, and combine 
forces to produce the threepence necessary for two glasses of beer, 
or wander down the Lothian Road without any, than that I should be 
strong and well at the age of forty-three in the island of Upolu, 
and that you should be at home bringing out the Edinburgh Edition?  
If it had been possible, I should almost have preferred the Lothian 
Road Edition, say, with a picture of the old Dutch smuggler on the 
covers.  I have now something heavy on my mind.  I had always a 
great sense of kinship with poor Robert Fergusson - so clever a 
boy, so wild, of such a mixed strain, so unfortunate, born in the 
same town with me, and, as I always felt, rather by express 
intimation than from evidence, so like myself.  Now the injustice 
with which the one Robert is rewarded and the other left out in the 
cold sits heavy on me, and I wish you could think of some way in 
which I could do honour to my unfortunate namesake.  Do you think 
it would look like affectation to dedicate the whole edition to his 
memory?  I think it would.  The sentiment which would dictate it to 
me is too abstruse; and besides, I think my wife is the proper 
person to receive the dedication of my life's work.  At the same 
time, it is very odd - it really looks like the transmigration of 
souls - I feel that I must do something for Fergusson; Burns has 
been before me with the gravestone.  It occurs to me you might take 
a walk down the Canongate and see in what condition the stone is.  
If it be at all uncared for, we might repair it, and perhaps add a 
few words of inscription.
</p><p>I must tell you, what I just remembered in a flash as I was walking 
about dictating this letter - there was in the original plan of the 
MASTER OF BALLANTRAE a sort of introduction describing my arrival 
in Edinburgh on a visit to yourself and your placing in my hands 
the papers of the story.  I actually wrote it, and then condemned 
the idea - as being a little too like Scott, I suppose.  Now I must 
really find the MS. and try to finish it for the E. E.  It will 
give you, what I should so much like you to have, another corner of 
your own in that lofty monument.
</p><p>Suppose we do what I have proposed about Fergusson's monument, I 
wonder if an inscription like this would look arrogant -
</p><p><br />
This stone originally erected
by Robert Burns has been
repaired at the
charges of Robert Louis Stevenson,
and is by him re-dedicated to
the memory of Robert Fergusson,
as the gift of one Edinburgh
lad to another.
</p><p><br />
In spacing this inscription I would detach the names of Fergusson 
and Burns, but leave mine in the text.
</p><p>Or would that look like sham modesty, and is it better to bring out 
the three Roberts?

<p><b>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JUNE 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR BOB, - I must make out a letter this mail or perish in the 
attempt.  All the same, I am deeply stupid, in bed with a cold, 
deprived of my amanuensis, and conscious of the wish but not the 
furnished will.  You may be interested to hear how the family 
inquiries go.  It is now quite certain that we are a second-rate 
lot, and came out of Cunningham or Clydesdale, therefore BRITISH 
folk; so that you are Cymry on both sides, and I Cymry and Pict.  
We may have fought with King Arthur and known Merlin.  The first of 
the family, Stevenson of Stevenson, was quite a great party, and 
dates back to the wars of Edward First.  The last male heir of 
Stevenson of Stevenson died 1670, 220 pounds, 10s. to the bad, from 
drink.  About the same time the Stevensons, who were mostly in 
Cunningham before, crop up suddenly in the parish of Neilston, over 
the border in Renfrewshire.  Of course, they may have been there 
before, but there is no word of them in that parish till 1675 in 
any extracts I have.  Our first traceable ancestor was a tenant 
farmer of Muir of Cauldwells - James in Nether-Carsewell.  
Presently two families of maltmen are found in Glasgow, both, by 
re-duplicated proofs, related to James (the son of James) in Nether 
Carsewell.  We descend by his second marriage from Robert; one of 
these died 1733.  It is not very romantic up to now, but has 
interested me surprisingly to fish out, always hoping for more - 
and occasionally getting at least a little clearness and 
confirmation.  But the earliest date, 1655, apparently the marriage 
of James in Nether Carsewell, cannot as yet be pushed back.  From 
which of any number of dozen little families in Cunningham we 
should derive, God knows!  Of course, it doesn't matter a hundred 
years hence, an argument fatal to all human enterprise, industry, 
or pleasure.  And to me it will be a deadly disappointment if I 
cannot roll this stone away!  One generation further might be 
nothing, but it is my present object of desire, and we are so near 
it!  There is a man in the same parish called Constantine; if I 
could only trace to him, I could take you far afield by that one 
talisman of the strange Christian name of Constantine.  But no such 
luck!  And I kind of fear we shall stick at James.
</p><p>So much, though all inchoate, I trouble you with, knowing that you, 
at least, must take an interest in it.  So much is certain of that 
strange Celtic descent, that the past has an interest for it 
apparently gratuitous, but fiercely strong.  I wish to trace my 
ancestors a thousand years, if I trace them by gallowses.  It is 
not love, not pride, not admiration; it is an expansion of the 
identity, intimately pleasing, and wholly uncritical; I can expend 
myself in the person of an inglorious ancestor with perfect 
comfort; or a disgraced, if I could find one.  I suppose, perhaps, 
it is more to me who am childless, and refrain with a certain shock 
from looking forwards.  But, I am sure, in the solid grounds of 
race, that you have it also in some degree.

<p>Enough genealogy.  I do not know if you will be able to read my 
hand.  Unhappily, Belle, who is my amanuensis, is out of the way on 
other affairs, and I have to make the unwelcome effort.  (O this is 
beautiful, I am quite pleased with myself.)  Graham has just 
arrived last night (my mother is coming by the other steamer in 
three days), and has told me of your meeting, and he said you 
looked a little older than I did; so that I suppose we keep step 
fairly on the downward side of the hill.  He thought you looked 
harassed, and I could imagine that too.  I sometimes feel harassed.  
I have a great family here about me, a great anxiety.  The loss (to 
use my grandfather's expression), the 'loss' of our family is that 
we are disbelievers in the morrow - perhaps I should say, rather, 
in next year.  The future is ALWAYS black to us; it was to Robert 
Stevenson; to Thomas; I suspect to Alan; to R. A. M. S. it was so 
almost to his ruin in youth; to R. L. S., who had a hard hopeful 
strain in him from his mother, it was not so much so once, but 
becomes daily more so.  Daily so much more so, that I have a 
painful difficulty in believing I can ever finish another book, or 
that the public will ever read it.
</p><p>I have so huge a desire to know exactly what you are doing, that I 
suppose I should tell you what I am doing by way of an example.  I 
have a room now, a part of the twelve-foot verandah sparred in, at 
the most inaccessible end of the house.  Daily I see the sunrise 
out of my bed, which I still value as a tonic, a perpetual tuning 
fork, a look of God's face once in the day.  At six my breakfast 
comes up to me here, and I work till eleven.  If I am quite well, I 
sometimes go out and bathe in the river before lunch, twelve.  In 
the afternoon I generally work again, now alone drafting, now with 
Belle dictating.  Dinner is at six, and I am often in bed by eight.  
This is supposing me to stay at home.  But I must often be away, 
sometimes all day long, sometimes till twelve, one, or two at 
night, when you might see me coming home to the sleeping house, 
sometimes in a trackless darkness, sometimes with a glorious tropic 
moon, everything drenched with dew - unsaddling and creeping to 
bed; and you would no longer be surprised that I live out in this 
country, and not in Bournemouth - in bed.
</p><p>My great recent interruptions have (as you know) come from 
politics; not much in my line, you will say.  But it is impossible 
to live here and not feel very sorely the consequences of the 
horrid white mismanagement.  I tried standing by and looking on, 
and it became too much for me.  They are such illogical fools; a 
logical fool in an office, with a lot of red tape, is conceivable.  
Furthermore, he is as much as we have any reason to expect of 
officials - a thoroughly common-place, unintellectual lot.  But 
these people are wholly on wires; laying their ears down, skimming 
away, pausing as though shot, and presto! full spread on the other 
tack.  I observe in the official class mostly an insane jealousy of 
the smallest kind, as compared to which the artist's is of a grave, 
modest character - the actor's, even; a desire to extend his little 
authority, and to relish it like a glass of wine, that is 
IMPAYABLE.  Sometimes, when I see one of these little kings 
strutting over one of his victories - wholly illegal, perhaps, and 
certain to be reversed to his shame if his superiors ever heard of 
it - I could weep.  The strange thing is that they HAVE NOTHING 
ELSE.  I auscultate them in vain; no real sense of duty, no real 
comprehension, no real attempt to comprehend, no wish for 
information - you cannot offend one of them more bitterly than by 
offering information, though it is certain that you have MORE, and 
obvious that you have OTHER, information than they have; and 
talking of policy, they could not play a better stroke than by 
listening to you, and it need by no means influence their action.  
TENEZ, you know what a French post office or railway official is?  
That is the diplomatic card to the life.  Dickens is not in it; 
caricature fails.
</p><p>All this keeps me from my work, and gives me the unpleasant side of 
the world.  When your letters are disbelieved it makes you angry, 
and that is rot; and I wish I could keep out of it with all my 
soul.  But I have just got into it again, and farewell peace!
</p><p>My work goes along but slowly.  I have got to a crossing place, I 
suppose; the present book, SAINT IVES, is nothing; it is in no 
style in particular, a tissue of adventures, the central character 
not very well done, no philosophic pith under the yarn; and, in 
short, if people will read it, that's all I ask; and if they won't, 
damn them!  I like doing it though; and if you ask me why! - after 
that I am on WEIR OF HERMISTON and HEATHERCAT, two Scotch stories, 
which will either be something different, or I shall have failed.  
The first is generally designed, and is a private story of two or 
three characters in a very grim vein.  The second - alas! the 
thought - is an attempt at a real historical novel, to present a 
whole field of time; the race - our own race - the west land and 
Clydesdale blue bonnets, under the influence of their last trial, 
when they got to a pitch of organisation in madness that no other 
peasantry has ever made an offer at.  I was going to call it THE 
KILLING TIME, but this man Crockett has forestalled me in that.  
Well, it'll be a big smash if I fail in it; but a gallant attempt.  
All my weary reading as a boy, which you remember well enough, will 
come to bear on it; and if my mind will keep up to the point it was 
in a while back, perhaps I can pull it through.
</p><p>For two months past, Fanny, Belle, Austin (her child), and I have 
been alone; but yesterday, as I mentioned, Graham Balfour arrived, 
and on Wednesday my mother and Lloyd will make up the party to its 
full strength.  I wish you could drop in for a month or a week, or 
two hours.  That is my chief want.  On the whole, it is an 
unexpectedly pleasant corner I have dropped into for an end of it, 
which I could scarcely have foreseen from Wilson's shop, or the 
Princes Street Gardens, or the Portobello Road.  Still, I would 
like to hear what my ALTER EGO thought of it; and I would sometimes 
like to have my old MAITRE ES ARTS express an opinion on what I do.  
I put this very tamely, being on the whole a quiet elderly man; but 
it is a strong passion with me, though intermittent.  Now, try to 
follow my example and tell me something about yourself, Louisa, the 
Bab, and your work; and kindly send me some specimens of what 
you're about.  I have only seen one thing by you, about Notre Dame 
in the WESTMINSTER or ST. JAMES'S, since I left England, now I 
suppose six years ago.
</p><p>I have looked this trash over, and it is not at all the letter I 
wanted to write - not truck about officials, ancestors, and the 
like rancidness - but you have to let your pen go in its own 
broken-down gait, like an old butcher's pony, stop when it pleases, 
and go on again as it will. - Ever, my dear Bob, your affectionate 
cousin,

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JULY 7TH, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR HENRY JAMES, - I am going to try and dictate to you a letter 
or a note, and begin the same without any spark of hope, my mind 
being entirely in abeyance.  This malady is very bitter on the 
literary man.  I have had it now coming on for a month, and it 
seems to get worse instead of better.  If it should prove to be 
softening of the brain, a melancholy interest will attach to the 
present document.  I heard a great deal about you from my mother 
and Graham Balfour; the latter declares that you could take a First 
in any Samoan subject.  If that be so, I should like to hear you on 
the theory of the constitution.  Also to consult you on the force 
of the particles O LO 'O and UA, which are the subject of a dispute 
among local pundits.  You might, if you ever answer this, give me 
your opinion on the origin of the Samoan race, just to complete the 
favour.
</p><p>They both say that you are looking well, and I suppose I may 
conclude from that that you are feeling passably.  I wish I was.  
Do not suppose from this that I am ill in body; it is the numskull 
that I complain of.  And when that is wrong, as you must be very 
keenly aware, you begin every day with a smarting disappointment, 
which is not good for the temper.  I am in one of the humours when 
a man wonders how any one can be such an ass as to embrace the 
profession of letters, and not get apprenticed to a barber or keep 
a baked-potato stall.  But I have no doubt in the course of a week, 
or perhaps to-morrow, things will look better.
</p><p>We have at present in port the model warship of Great Britain.  She 
is called the CURACOA, and has the nicest set of officers and men 
conceivable.  They, the officers, are all very intimate with us, 
and the front verandah is known as the Curacoa Club, and the road 
up to Vailima is known as the Curacoa Track.  It was rather a 
surprise to me; many naval officers have I known, and somehow had 
not learned to think entirely well of them, and perhaps sometimes 
ask myself a little uneasily how that kind of men could do great 
actions? and behold! the answer comes to me, and I see a ship that 
I would guarantee to go anywhere it was possible for men to go, and 
accomplish anything it was permitted man to attempt.  I had a 
cruise on board of her not long ago to Manu'a, and was delighted.  
The goodwill of all on board; the grim playfulness of - quarters, 
with the wounded falling down at the word; the ambulances hastening 
up and carrying them away; the Captain suddenly crying, 'Fire in 
the ward-room!' and the squad hastening forward with the hose; and, 
last and most curious spectacle of all, all the men in their dust-
coloured fatigue clothes, at a note of the bugle, falling 
simultaneously flat on deck, and the ship proceeding with its 
prostrate crew - QUASI to ram an enemy; our dinner at night in a 
wild open anchorage, the ship rolling almost to her gunwales, and 
showing us alternately her bulwarks up in the sky, and then the 
wild broken cliffy palm-crested shores of the island with the surf 
thundering and leaping close aboard.  We had the ward-room mess on 
deck, lit by pink wax tapers, everybody, of course, in uniform but 
myself, and the first lieutenant (who is a rheumaticky body) 
wrapped in a boat cloak.  Gradually the sunset faded out, the 
island disappeared from the eye, though it remained menacingly 
present to the ear with the voice of the surf; and then the captain 
turned on the searchlight and gave us the coast, the beach, the 
trees, the native houses, and the cliffs by glimpses of daylight, a 
kind of deliberate lightning.  About which time, I suppose, we must 
have come as far as the dessert, and were probably drinking our 
first glass of port to Her Majesty.  We stayed two days at the 
island, and had, in addition, a very picturesque snapshot at the 
native life.  The three islands of Manu'a are independent, and are 
ruled over by a little slip of a half-caste girl about twenty, who 
sits all day in a pink gown, in a little white European house with 
about a quarter of an acre of roses in front of it, looking at the 
palm-trees on the village street, and listening to the surf.  This, 
so far as I could discover, was all she had to do.  'This is a very 
dull place,' she said.  It appears she could go to no other village 
for fear of raising the jealousy of her own people in the capital.  
And as for going about 'tafatafaoing,' as we say here, its cost was 
too enormous.  A strong able-bodied native must walk in front of 
her and blow the conch shell continuously from the moment she 
leaves one house until the moment she enters another.  Did you ever 
blow the conch shell?  I presume not; but the sweat literally 
hailed off that man, and I expected every moment to see him burst a 
blood-vessel.  We were entertained to kava in the guest-house with 
some very original features.  The young men who run for the KAVA 
have a right to misconduct themselves AD LIBITUM on the way back; 
and though they were told to restrain themselves on the occasion of 
our visit, there was a strange hurly-burly at their return, when 
they came beating the trees and the posts of the houses, leaping, 
shouting, and yelling like Bacchants.
</p><p>I tasted on that occasion what it is to be great.  My name was 
called next after the captain's, and several chiefs (a thing quite 
new to me, and not at all Samoan practice) drank to me by name.
</p><p>And now, if you are not sick of the CURACOA and Manu'a, I am, at 
least on paper.  And I decline any longer to give you examples of 
how not to write.
</p><p>By the by, you sent me long ago a work by Anatole France, which I 
confess I did not TASTE.  Since then I have made the acquaintance 
of the ABBE COIGNARD, and have become a faithful adorer.  I don't 
think a better book was ever written.
</p><p>And I have no idea what I have said, and I have no idea what I 
ought to have said, and I am a total ass, but my heart is in the 
right place, and I am, my dear Henry James, yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MR. MARCEL SCHWOB</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, UPOLU, SAMOA, JULY 7, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR MR. MARCEL SCHWOB, - Thank you for having remembered me in my 
exile.  I have read MIMES twice as a whole; and now, as I write, I 
am reading it again as it were by accident, and a piece at a time, 
my eye catching a word and travelling obediently on through the 
whole number.  It is a graceful book, essentially graceful, with 
its haunting agreeable melancholy, its pleasing savour of 
antiquity.  At the same time, by its merits, it shows itself rather 
as the promise of something else to come than a thing final in 
itself.  You have yet to give us - and I am expecting it with 
impatience - something of a larger gait; something daylit, not 
twilit; something with the colours of life, not the flat tints of a 
temple illumination; something that shall be SAID with all the 
clearnesses and the trivialities of speech, not SUNG like a semi-
articulate lullaby.  It will not please yourself as well, when you 
come to give it us, but it will please others better.  It will be 
more of a whole, more worldly, more nourished, more commonplace - 
and not so pretty, perhaps not even so beautiful.  No man knows 
better than I that, as we go on in life, we must part from 
prettiness and the graces.  We but attain qualities to lose them; 
life is a series of farewells, even in art; even our proficiencies 
are deciduous and evanescent.  So here with these exquisite pieces 
the XVIIth, XVIIIth, and IVth of the present collection.  You will 
perhaps never excel them; I should think the 'Hermes,' never.  
Well, you will do something else, and of that I am in expectation. 
- Yours cordially,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, JULY 8, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS, - This is to tell you that the medallion has 
been at last triumphantly transported up the hill and placed over 
my smoking-room mantelpiece.  It is considered by everybody a 
first-rate but flattering portrait.  We have it in a very good 
light, which brings out the artistic merits of the god-like 
sculptor to great advantage.  As for my own opinion, I believe it 
to be a speaking likeness, and not flattered at all; possibly a 
little the reverse.  The verses (curse the rhyme) look remarkably 
well.
</p><p>Please do not longer delay, but send me an account for the expense 
of the gilt letters.  I was sorry indeed that they proved beyond 
the means of a small farmer. - Yours very sincerely,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JULY 14, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR ADELAIDE, - . . . So, at last, you are going into mission 
work? where I think your heart always was.  You will like it in a 
way, but remember it is dreary long.  Do you know the story of the 
American tramp who was offered meals and a day's wage to chop with 
the back of an axe on a fallen trunk.  'Damned if I can go on 
chopping when I can't see the chips fly!'  You will never see the 
chips fly in mission work, never; and be sure you know it 
beforehand.  The work is one long dull disappointment, varied by 
acute revulsions; and those who are by nature courageous and 
cheerful and have grown old in experience, learn to rub their hands 
over infinitesimal successes.  However, as I really believe there 
is some good done in the long run - GUTTA CAVAT LAPIDEM NON VI in 
this business - it is a useful and honourable career in which no 
one should be ashamed to embark.  Always remember the fable of the 
sun, the storm, and the traveller's cloak.  Forget wholly and for 
ever all small pruderies, and remember that YOU CANNOT CHANGE 
ANCESTRAL FEELINGS OF RIGHT AND WRONG WITHOUT WHAT IS PRACTICALLY 
SOUL-MURDER.  Barbarous as the customs may seem, always hear them 
with patience, always judge them with gentleness, always find in 
them some seed of good; see that you always develop them; remember 
that all you can do is to civilise the man in the line of his own 
civilisation, such as it is.  And never expect, never believe in, 
thaumaturgic conversions.  They may do very well for St. Paul; in 
the case of an Andaman islander they mean less than nothing.  In 
fact, what you have to do is to teach the parents in the interests 
of their great-grandchildren.
</p><p>Now, my dear Adelaide, dismiss from your mind the least idea of 
fault upon your side; nothing is further from the fact.  I cannot 
forgive you, for I do not know your fault.  My own is plain enough, 
and the name of it is cold-hearted neglect; and you may busy 
yourself more usefully in trying to forgive me.  But ugly as my 
fault is, you must not suppose it to mean more than it does; it 
does not mean that we have at all forgotten you, that we have 
become at all indifferent to the thought of you.  See, in my life 
of Jenkin, a remark of his, very well expressed, on the friendships 
of men who do not write to each other.  I can honestly say that I 
have not changed to you in any way; though I have behaved thus ill, 
thus cruelly.  Evil is done by want of - well, principally by want 
of industry.  You can imagine what I would say (in a novel) of any 
one who had behaved as I have done, DETERIORA SEQUOR.  And you must 
somehow manage to forgive your old friend; and if you will be so 
very good, continue to give us news of you, and let us share the 
knowledge of your adventures, sure that it will be always followed 
with interest - even if it is answered with the silence of 
ingratitude.  For I am not a fool; I know my faults, I know they 
are ineluctable, I know they are growing on me.  I know I may 
offend again, and I warn you of it.  But the next time I offend, 
tell me so plainly and frankly like a lady, and don't lacerate my 
heart and bludgeon my vanity with imaginary faults of your own and 
purely gratuitous penitence.  I might suspect you of irony!
</p><p>We are all fairly well, though I have been off work and off - as 
you know very well - letter-writing.  Yet I have sometimes more 
than twenty letters, and sometimes more than thirty, going out each 
mail.  And Fanny has had a most distressing bronchitis for some 
time, which she is only now beginning to get over.  I have just 
been to see her; she is lying - though she had breakfast an hour 
ago, about seven - in her big cool, mosquito-proof room, 
ingloriously asleep.  As for me, you see that a doom has come upon 
me:  I cannot make marks with a pen - witness 'ingloriously' above; 
and my amanuensis not appearing so early in the day, for she is 
then immersed in household affairs, and I can hear her 'steering 
the boys' up and down the verandahs - you must decipher this 
unhappy letter for yourself and, I fully admit, with everything 
against you.  A letter should be always well written; how much more 
a letter of apology!  Legibility is the politeness of men of 
letters, as punctuality of kings and beggars.  By the punctuality 
of my replies, and the beauty of my hand-writing, judge what a fine 
conscience I must have!
</p><p>Now, my dear gamekeeper, I must really draw to a close.  For I have 
much else to write before the mail goes out three days hence.  
Fanny being asleep, it would not be conscientious to invent a 
message from her, so you must just imagine her sentiments.  I find 
I have not the heart to speak of your recent loss.  You remember 
perhaps, when my father died, you told me those ugly images of 
sickness, decline, and impaired reason, which then haunted me day 
and night, would pass away and be succeeded by things more happily 
characteristic.  I have found it so.  He now haunts me, strangely 
enough, in two guises; as a man of fifty, lying on a hillside and 
carving mottoes on a stick, strong and well; and as a younger man, 
running down the sands into the sea near North Berwick, myself - 
AETAT. II - somewhat horrified at finding him so beautiful when 
stripped!  I hand on your own advice to you in case you have 
forgotten it, as I know one is apt to do in seasons of bereavement. 
- Ever yours, with much love and sympathy,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, JULY 16, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR MRS. BAKER, - I am very much obliged to you for your letter 
and the enclosure from Mr. Skinner.  Mr. Skinner says he 'thinks 
Mr. Stevenson must be a very kind man'; he little knows me.  But I 
am very sure of one thing, that you are a very kind woman.  I envy 
you - my amanuensis being called away, I continue in my own hand, 
or what is left of it - unusually legible, I am thankful to see - I 
envy you your beautiful choice of an employment.  There must be no 
regrets at least for a day so spent; and when the night falls you 
need ask no blessing on your work.

<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO J. M. BARRIE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, JULY 13, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR BARRIE, - This is the last effort of an ulcerated 
conscience.  I have been so long owing you a letter, I have heard 
so much of you, fresh from the press, from my mother and Graham 
Balfour, that I have to write a letter no later than to-day, or 
perish in my shame.  But the deuce of it is, my dear fellow, that 
you write such a very good letter that I am ashamed to exhibit 
myself before my junior (which you are, after all) in the light of 
the dreary idiot I feel.  Understand that there will be nothing 
funny in the following pages.  If I can manage to be rationally 
coherent, I shall be more than satisfied.
</p><p>In the first place, I have had the extreme satisfaction to be shown 
that photograph of your mother.  It bears evident traces of the 
hand of an amateur.  How is it that amateurs invariably take better 
photographs than professionals?  I must qualify invariably.  My own 
negatives have always represented a province of chaos and old night 
in which you might dimly perceive fleecy spots of twilight, 
representing nothing; so that, if I am right in supposing the 
portrait of your mother to be yours, I must salute you as my 
superior.  Is that your mother's breakfast?  Or is it only 
afternoon tea?  If the first, do let me recommend to Mrs. Barrie to 
add an egg to her ordinary.  Which, if you please, I will ask her 
to eat to the honour of her son, and I am sure she will live much 
longer for it, to enjoy his fresh successes.  I never in my life 
saw anything more deliciously characteristic.  I declare I can hear 
her speak.  I wonder my mother could resist the temptation of your 
proposed visit to Kirriemuir, which it was like your kindness to 
propose.  By the way, I was twice in Kirriemuir, I believe in the 
year '71, when I was going on a visit to Glenogil.  It was 
Kirriemuir, was it not?  I have a distinct recollection of an inn 
at the end - I think the upper end - of an irregular open place or 
square, in which I always see your characters evolve.  But, indeed, 
I did not pay much attention; being all bent upon my visit to a 
shooting-box, where I should fish a real trout-stream, and I 
believe preserved.  I did, too, and it was a charming stream, clear 
as crystal, without a trace of peat - a strange thing in Scotland - 
and alive with trout; the name of it I cannot remember, it was 
something like the Queen's River, and in some hazy way connected 
with memories of Mary Queen of Scots.  It formed an epoch in my 
life, being the end of all my trout-fishing.  I had always been 
accustomed to pause and very laboriously to kill every fish as I 
took it.  But in the Queen's River I took so good a basket that I 
forgot these niceties; and when I sat down, in a hard rain shower, 
under a bank, to take my sandwiches and sherry, lo! and behold, 
there was the basketful of trouts still kicking in their agony.  I 
had a very unpleasant conversation with my conscience.  All that 
afternoon I persevered in fishing, brought home my basket in 
triumph, and sometime that night, 'in the wee sma' hours ayont the 
twal,' I finally forswore the gentle craft of fishing.  I dare say 
your local knowledge may identify this historic river; I wish it 
could go farther and identify also that particular Free kirk in 
which I sat and groaned on Sunday.  While my hand is in I must tell 
you a story.  At that antique epoch you must not fall into the 
vulgar error that I was myself ancient.  I was, on the contrary, 
very young, very green, and (what you will appreciate, Mr. Barrie) 
very shy.  There came one day to lunch at the house two very 
formidable old ladies - or one very formidable, and the other what 
you please - answering to the honoured and historic name of the 
Miss C- A-'s of Balnamoon.  At table I was exceedingly funny, and 
entertained the company with tales of geese and bubbly-jocks.  I 
was great in the expression of my terror for these bipeds, and 
suddenly this horrid, severe, and eminently matronly old lady put 
up a pair of gold eye-glasses, looked at me awhile in silence, and 
pronounced in a clangorous voice her verdict.  'You give me very 
much the effect of a coward, Mr. Stevenson!'  I had very nearly 
left two vices behind me at Glenogil - fishing and jesting at 
table.  And of one thing you may be very sure, my lips were no more 
opened at that meal.
</p><p>JULY 29TH
</p><p>No, Barrie, 'tis in vain they try to alarm me with their bulletins.  
No doubt, you're ill, and unco ill, I believe; but I have been so 
often in the same case that I know pleurisy and pneumonia are in 
vain against Scotsmen who can write, (I once could.)  You cannot 
imagine probably how near me this common calamity brings you.  CE 
QUE J'AI TOUSSE DANS MA VIE!  How often and how long have I been on 
the rack at night and learned to appreciate that noble passage in 
the Psalms when somebody or other is said to be more set on 
something than they 'who dig for hid treasures - yea, than those 
who long for the morning' - for all the world, as you have been 
racked and you have longed.  Keep your heart up, and you'll do.  
Tell that to your mother, if you are still in any danger or 
suffering.  And by the way, if you are at all like me - and I tell 
myself you are very like me - be sure there is only one thing good 
for you, and that is the sea in hot climates.  Mount, sir, into 'a 
little frigot' of 5000 tons or so, and steer peremptorily for the 
tropics; and what if the ancient mariner, who guides your frigot, 
should startle the silence of the ocean with the cry of land ho! - 
say, when the day is dawning - and you should see the turquoise 
mountain tops of Upolu coming hand over fist above the horizon?  
Mr. Barrie, sir, 'tis then there would be larks!  And though I 
cannot be certain that our climate would suit you (for it does not 
suit some), I am sure as death the voyage would do you good - would 
do you BEST - and if Samoa didn't do, you needn't stay beyond the 
month, and I should have had another pleasure in my life, which is 
a serious consideration for me.  I take this as the hand of the 
Lord preparing your way to Vailima - in the desert, certainly - in 
the desert of Cough and by the ghoul-haunted woodland of Fever - 
but whither that way points there can be no question - and there 
will be a meeting of the twa Hoasting Scots Makers in spite of 
fate, fortune, and the Devil.  ABSIT OMEN!
</p><p>My dear Barrie, I am a little in the dark about this new work of 
yours:  what is to become of me afterwards?  You say carefully - 
methought anxiously - that I was no longer me when I grew up?  I 
cannot bear this suspense:  what is it?  It's no forgery?  And AM I 
HANGIT?  These are the elements of a very pretty lawsuit which you 
had better come to Samoa to compromise.  I am enjoying a great 
pleasure that I had long looked forward to, reading Orme's HISTORY 
OF INDOSTAN; I had been looking out for it everywhere; but at last, 
in four volumes, large quarto, beautiful type and page, and with a 
delectable set of maps and plans, and all the names of the places 
wrongly spelled - it came to Samoa, little Barrie.  I tell you 
frankly, you had better come soon.  I am sair failed a'ready; and 
what I may be if you continue to dally, I dread to conceive.  I may 
be speechless; already, or at least for a month or so, I'm little 
better than a teetoller - I beg pardon, a teetotaller.  It is not 
exactly physical, for I am in good health, working four or five 
hours a day in my plantation, and intending to ride a paper-chase 
next Sunday - ay, man, that's a fact, and I havena had the hert to 
breathe it to my mother yet - the obligation's poleetical, for I am 
trying every means to live well with my German neighbours - and, O 
Barrie, but it's no easy!  To be sure, there are many exceptions.  
And the whole of the above must be regarded as private - strictly 
private.  Breathe it not in Kirriemuir:  tell it not to the 
daughters of Dundee!  What a nice extract this would make for the 
daily papers! and how it would facilitate my position here! . . .
</p><p>AUGUST 5TH.
</p><p>This is Sunday, the Lord's Day.  'The hour of attack approaches.'  
And it is a singular consideration what I risk; I may yet be the 
subject of a tract, and a good tract too - such as one which I 
remember reading with recreant awe and rising hair in my youth, of 
a boy who was a very good boy, and went to Sunday Schule, and one 
day kipped from it, and went and actually bathed, and was dashed 
over a waterfall, and he was the only son of his mother, and she 
was a widow.  A dangerous trade, that, and one that I have to 
practise.  I'll put in a word when I get home again, to tell you 
whether I'm killed or not.  'Accident in the (Paper) Hunting Field:  
death of a notorious author.  We deeply regret to announce the 
death of the most unpopular man in Samoa, who broke his neck at the 
descent of Magagi, from the misconduct of his little raving lunatic 
of an old beast of a pony.  It is proposed to commemorate the 
incident by the erection of a suitable pile.  The design (by our 
local architect, Mr. Walker) is highly artificial, with a rich and 
voluminous Crockett at each corner, a small but impervious Barrieer 
at the entrance, an arch at the top, an Archer of a pleasing but 
solid character at the bottom; the colour will be genuine William-
Black; and Lang, lang may the ladies sit wi' their fans in their 
hands.'  Well, well, they may sit as they sat for me, and little 
they'll reck, the ungrateful jauds!  Muckle they cared about 
Tusitala when they had him!  But now ye can see the difference; 
now, leddies, ye can repent, when ower late, o' your former 
cauldness and what ye'll perhaps allow me to ca' your TEPEEDITY!  
He was beautiful as the day, but his day is done!  And perhaps, as 
he was maybe gettin' a wee thing fly-blawn, it's nane too shune.
</p><p>MONDAY, AUGUST 6TH.
</p><p>Well, sir, I have escaped the dangerous conjunction of the widow's 
only son and the Sabbath Day.  We had a most enjoyable time, and 
Lloyd and I were 3 and 4 to arrive; I will not tell here what 
interval had elapsed between our arrival and the arrival of 1 and 
2; the question, sir, is otiose and malign; it deserves, it shall 
have no answer.  And now without further delay to the main purpose 
of this hasty note.  We received and we have already in fact 
distributed the gorgeous fahbrics of Kirriemuir.  Whether from the 
splendour of the robes themselves, or from the direct nature of the 
compliments with which you had directed us to accompany the 
presentations, one young lady blushed as she received the proofs of 
your munificence. . . . Bad ink, and the dregs of it at that, but 
the heart in the right place.  Still very cordially interested in 
my Barrie and wishing him well through his sickness, which is of 
the body, and long defended from mine, which is of the head, and by 
the impolite might be described as idiocy.  The whole head is 
useless, and the whole sitting part painful:  reason, the recent 
Paper Chase.
</p><p><br />
There was racing and chasing in Vailile plantation,
And vastly we enjoyed it,
But, alas! for the state of my foundation,
For it wholly has destroyed it.
</p><p><br />
Come, my mind is looking up.  The above is wholly impromptu. - On 
oath,
</p><p>TUSITALA.
</p><p>AUGUST 12, 1894
</p><p>And here, Mr. Barrie, is news with a vengeance.  Mother Hubbard's 
dog is well again - what did I tell you?  Pleurisy, pneumonia, and 
all that kind of truck is quite unavailing against a Scotchman who 
can write - and not only that, but it appears the perfidious dog is 
married.  This incident, so far as I remember, is omitted from the 
original epic -
</p><p><br />
She went to the graveyard
To see him get him buried,
And when she came back
The Deil had got merried.
</p><p><br />
It now remains to inform you that I have taken what we call here 
'German offence' at not receiving cards, and that the only 
reparation I will accept is that Mrs. Barrie shall incontinently 
upon the receipt of this Take and Bring you to Vailima in order to 
apologise and be pardoned for this offence.  The commentary of 
Tamaitai upon the event was brief but pregnant:  'Well, it's a 
comfort our guest-room is furnished for two.'
</p><p>This letter, about nothing, has already endured too long.  I shall 
just present the family to Mrs. Barrie - Tamaitai, Tamaitai Matua, 
Teuila, Palema, Loia, and with an extra low bow, Yours,
</p><p>TUSITALA.

<p><b>Letter:  TO DR. BAKEWELL</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, AUGUST 7, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR DR. BAKEWELL, - I am not more than human.  I am more human 
than is wholly convenient, and your anecdote was welcome.  What you 
say about UNWILLING WORK, my dear sir, is a consideration always 
present with me, and yet not easy to give its due weight to.  You 
grow gradually into a certain income; without spending a penny 
more, with the same sense of restriction as before when you 
painfully scraped two hundred a year together, you find you have 
spent, and you cannot well stop spending, a far larger sum; and 
this expense can only be supported by a certain production.  
However, I am off work this month, and occupy myself instead in 
weeding my cacao, paper chases, and the like.  I may tell you, my 
average of work in favourable circumstances is far greater than you 
suppose:  from six o'clock till eleven at latest, and often till 
twelve, and again in the afternoon from two to four.  My hand is 
quite destroyed, as you may perceive, to-day to a really unusual 
extent.  I can sometimes write a decent fist still; but I have just 
returned with my arms all stung from three hours' work in the 
cacao. - Yours, etc.,

<p><b>Letter:  TO JAMES PAYN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, UPOLU, SAMOA [AUGUST 11, 1894].
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - I hear from Lang that you are unwell, and it 
reminds me of two circumstances:  First, that it is a very long 
time since you had the exquisite pleasure of hearing from me; and 
second, that I have been very often unwell myself, and sometimes 
had to thank you for a grateful anodyne.
</p><p>They are not good, the circumstances, to write an anodyne letter.  
The hills and my house at less than (boom) a minute's interval 
quake with thunder; and though I cannot hear that part of it, 
shells are falling thick into the fort of Luatuanu'u (boom).  It is 
my friends of the CURACOA, the FALKE, and the BUSSARD bombarding 
(after all these - boom - months) the rebels of Atua.  (Boom-boom.)  
It is most distracting in itself; and the thought of the poor 
devils in their fort (boom) with their bits of rifles far from 
pleasant.  (Boom-boom.)  You can see how quick it goes, and I'll 
say no more about Mr. Bow-wow, only you must understand the 
perpetual accompaniment of this discomfortable sound, and make 
allowances for the value of my copy.  It is odd, though, I can well 
remember, when the Franco-Prussian war began, and I was in Eilean 
Earraid, far enough from the sound of the loudest cannonade, I 
could HEAR the shots fired, and I felt the pang in my breast of a 
man struck.  It was sometimes so distressing, so instant, that I 
lay in the heather on the top of the island, with my face hid, 
kicking my heels for agony.  And now, when I can hear the actual 
concussion of the air and hills, when I KNOW personally the people 
who stand exposed to it, I am able to go on TANT BIEN QUE MAL with 
a letter to James Payn!  The blessings of age, though mighty small, 
are tangible.  I have heard a great deal of them since I came into 
the world, and now that I begin to taste of them - Well!  But this 
is one, that people do get cured of the excess of sensibility; and 
I had as lief these people were shot at as myself - or almost, for 
then I should have some of the fun, such as it is.
</p><p>You are to conceive me, then, sitting in my little gallery room, 
shaken by these continual spasms of cannon, and with my eye more or 
less singly fixed on the imaginary figure of my dear James Payn.  I 
try to see him in bed; no go.  I see him instead jumping up in his 
room in Waterloo Place (where EX HYPOTHESI he is not), sitting on 
the table, drawing out a very black briar-root pipe, and beginning 
to talk to a slim and ill-dressed visitor in a voice that is good 
to hear and with a smile that is pleasant to see.  (After a little 
more than half an hour, the voice that was ill to hear has ceased, 
the cannonade is over.)  And I am thinking how I can get an 
answering smile wafted over so many leagues of land and water, and 
can find no way.
</p><p>I have always been a great visitor of the sick; and one of the sick 
I visited was W. E. Henley, which did not make very tedious visits, 
so I'll not get off much purgatory for them.  That was in the 
Edinburgh Infirmary, the old one, the true one, with Georgius 
Secundus standing and pointing his toe in a niche of the facade; 
and a mighty fine building it was!  And I remember one winter's 
afternoon, in that place of misery, that Henley and I chanced to 
fall in talk about James Payn himself.  I am wishing you could have 
heard that talk!  I think that would make you smile.  We had mixed 
you up with John Payne, for one thing, and stood amazed at your 
extraordinary, even painful, versatility; and for another, we found 
ourselves each students so well prepared for examinations on the 
novels of the real Mackay.  Perhaps, after all, this is worth 
something in life - to have given so much pleasure to a pair so 
different in every way as were Henley and I, and to be talked of 
with so much interest by two such (beg pardon) clever lads!
</p><p>The cheerful Lang has neglected to tell me what is the matter with 
you; so, I'm sorry to say, I am cut off from all the customary 
consolations.  I can't say, 'Think how much worse it would be if 
you had a broken leg!' when you may have the crushing repartee up 
your sleeve, 'But it is my leg that is broken.'  This is a pity.  
But there are consolations.  You are an Englishman (I believe); you 
are a man of letters; you have never been made C.B.; your hair was 
not red; you have played cribbage and whist; you did not play 
either the fiddle or the banjo; you were never an aesthete; you 
never contributed to -'S JOURNAL; your name is not Jabez Balfour; 
you are totally unconnected with the Army and Navy departments; I 
understand you to have lived within your income - why, cheer up! 
here are many legitimate causes of congratulation.  I seem to be 
writing an obituary notice.  ABSIT OMEN!  But I feel very sure that 
these considerations will have done you more good than medicine.
</p><p>By the by, did you ever play piquet?  I have fallen a victim to 
this debilitating game.  It is supposed to be scientific; God save 
the mark, what self-deceivers men are!  It is distinctly less so 
than cribbage.  But how fascinating!  There is such material 
opulence about it, such vast ambitions may be realised - and are 
not; it may be called the Monte Cristo of games.  And the thrill 
with which you take five cards partakes of the nature of lust - and 
you draw four sevens and a nine, and the seven and nine of a suit 
that you discarded, and O! but the world is a desert!  You may see 
traces of discouragement in my letter:  all due to piquet!  There 
has been a disastrous turn of the luck against me; a month or two 
ago I was two thousand ahead; now, and for a week back, I have been 
anything from four thousand eight hundred to five thousand two 
hundred astern.  If I have a sixieme, my beast of a partner has a 
septieme; and if I have three aces, three kings, three queens, and 
three knaves (excuse the slight exaggeration), the devil holds 
quatorze of tens! - I remain, my dear James Payn, your sincere and 
obliged friend - old friend let me say,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS MIDDLETON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, SEPTEMBER 9, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR MISS MIDDLETON, - Your letter has been like the drawing up of 
a curtain.  Of course I remember you very well, and the Skye 
terrier to which you refer - a heavy, dull, fatted, graceless 
creature he grew up to be - was my own particular pet.  It may 
amuse you, perhaps, as much as 'The Inn' amused me, if I tell you 
what made this dog particularly mine.  My father was the natural 
god of all the dogs in our house, and poor Jura took to him of 
course.  Jura was stolen, and kept in prison somewhere for more 
than a week, as I remember.  When he came back Smeoroch had come 
and taken my father's heart from him.  He took his stand like a 
man, and positively never spoke to my father again from that day 
until the day of his death.  It was the only sign of character he 
ever showed.  I took him up to my room and to be my dog in 
consequence, partly because I was sorry for him, and partly because 
I admired his dignity in misfortune.
</p><p>With best regards and thanks for having reminded me of so many 
pleasant days, old acquaintances, dead friends, and - what is 
perhaps as pathetic as any of them - dead dogs, I remain, yours 
truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO A. CONAN DOYLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, SEPTEMBER 9, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR CONAN DOYLE, - If you found anything to entertain you in my 
TREASURE ISLAND article, it may amuse you to know that you owe it 
entirely to yourself.  YOUR 'First Book' was by some accident read 
aloud one night in my Baronial 'All.  I was consumedly amused by 
it, so was the whole family, and we proceeded to hunt up back 
IDLERS and read the whole series.  It is a rattling good series, 
even people whom you would not expect came in quite the proper tone 
- Miss Braddon, for instance, who was really one of the best where 
all are good - or all but one! ...  In short, I fell in love with 
'The First Book' series, and determined that it should be all our 
first books, and that I could not hold back where the white plume 
of Conan Doyle waved gallantly in the front.  I hope they will 
republish them, though it's a grievous thought to me that that 
effigy in the German cap - likewise the other effigy of the noisome 
old man with the long hair, telling indelicate stories to a couple 
of deformed negresses in a rancid shanty full of wreckage - should 
be perpetuated.  I may seem to speak in pleasantry - it is only a 
seeming - that German cap, sir, would be found, when I come to die, 
imprinted on my heart.  Enough - my heart is too full.  Adieu. - 
Yours very truly,

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, SEPTEMBER 1894.]
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - . . . Well, there is no more Edmund Baxter now; 
and I think I may say I know how you feel.  He was one of the best, 
the kindest, and the most genial men I ever knew.  I shall always 
remember his brisk, cordial ways and the essential goodness which 
he showed me whenever we met with gratitude.  And the always is 
such a little while now!  He is another of the landmarks gone; when 
it comes to my own turn to lay my weapons down, I shall do so with 
thankfulness and fatigue; and whatever be my destiny afterward, I 
shall be glad to lie down with my fathers in honour.  It is human 
at least, if not divine.  And these deaths make me think of it with 
an ever greater readiness.  Strange that you should be beginning a 
new life, when I, who am a little your junior, am thinking of the 
end of mine.  But I have had hard lines; I have been so long 
waiting for death, I have unwrapped my thoughts from about life so 
long, that I have not a filament left to hold by; I have done my 
fiddling so long under Vesuvius, that I have almost forgotten to 
play, and can only wait for the eruption, and think it long of 
coming.  Literally, no man has more wholly outlived life than I.  
And still it's good fun.

<p><b>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, SEPTEMBER 1894.]
</p><p>DEAR BOB, - You are in error about the Picts.  They were a Gaelic 
race, spoke a Celtic tongue, and we have no evidence that I know of 
that they were blacker than other Celts.  The Balfours, I take it, 
were plainly Celts; their name shows it - the 'cold croft,' it 
means; so does their country.  Where the BLACK Scotch come from 
nobody knows; but I recognise with you the fact that the whole of 
Britain is rapidly and progressively becoming more pigmented; 
already in one man's life I can decidedly trace a difference in the 
children about a school door.  But colour is not an essential part 
of a man or a race.  Take my Polynesians, an Asiatic people 
probably from the neighbourhood of the Persian gulf.  They range 
through any amount of shades, from the burnt hue of the Low 
Archipelago islander, which seems half negro, to the 'bleached' 
pretty women of the Marquesas (close by on the map), who come out 
for a festival no darker than an Italian; their colour seems to 
vary directly with the degree of exposure to the sun.  And, as with 
negroes, the babes are born white; only it should seem a LITTLE 
SACK of pigment at the lower part of the spine, which presently 
spreads over the whole field.  Very puzzling.  But to return.  The 
Picts furnish to-day perhaps a third of the population of Scotland, 
say another third for Scots and Britons, and the third for Norse 
and Angles is a bad third.  Edinburgh was a Pictish place.  But the 
fact is, we don't know their frontiers.  Tell some of your 
journalist friends with a good style to popularise old Skene; or 
say your prayers, and read him for yourself; he was a Great 
Historian, and I was his blessed clerk, and did not know it; and 
you will not be in a state of grace about the Picts till you have 
studied him.  J. Horne Stevenson (do you know him?) is working this 
up with me, and the fact is - it's not interesting to the public - 
but it's interesting, and very interesting, in itself, and just now 
very embarrassing - this rural parish supplied Glasgow with such a 
quantity of Stevensons in the beginning of last century!  There is 
just a link wanting; and we might be able to go back to the 
eleventh century, always undistinguished, but clearly traceable.  
When I say just a link, I guess I may be taken to mean a dozen.  
What a singular thing is this undistinguished perpetuation of a 
family throughout the centuries, and the sudden bursting forth of 
character and capacity that began with our grandfather!  But as I 
go on in life, day by day, I become more of a bewildered child; I 
cannot get used to this world, to procreation, to heredity, to 
sight, to hearing; the commonest things are a burthen.  The prim 
obliterated polite face of life, and the broad, bawdy, and 
orgiastic - or maenadic - foundations, form a spectacle to which no 
habit reconciles me; and 'I could wish my days to be bound each to 
each' by the same open-mouthed wonder.  They ARE anyway, and 
whether I wish it or not.
</p><p>I remember very well your attitude to life, this conventional 
surface of it.  You had none of that curiosity for the social stage 
directions, the trivial FICELLES of the business; it is simian, but 
that is how the wild youth of man is captured; you wouldn't 
imitate, hence you kept free - a wild dog, outside the kennel - and 
came dam' near starving for your pains.  The key to the business is 
of course the belly; difficult as it is to keep that in view in the 
zone of three miraculous meals a day in which we were brought up.  
Civilisation has become reflex with us; you might think that hunger 
was the name of the best sauce; but hunger to the cold solitary 
under a bush of a rainy night is the name of something quite 
different.  I defend civilisation for the thing it is, for the 
thing it has COME to be, the standpoint of a real old Tory.  My 
ideal would be the Female Clan.  But how can you turn these 
crowding dumb multitudes BACK?  They don't do anything BECAUSE; 
they do things, write able articles, stitch shoes, dig, from the 
purely simian impulse.  Go and reason with monkeys!
</p><p>No, I am right about Jean Lillie.  Jean Lillie, our double great-
grandmother, the daughter of David Lillie, sometime Deacon of the 
Wrights, married, first, Alan Stevenson, who died May 26, 1774, 'at 
Santt Kittes of a fiver,' by whom she had Robert Stevenson, born 
8th June 1772; and, second, in May or June 1787, Thomas Smith, a 
widower, and already the father of our grandmother.  This 
improbable double connection always tends to confuse a student of 
the family, Thomas Smith being doubly our great-grandfather.
</p><p>I looked on the perpetuation of our honoured name with veneration.  
My mother collared one of the photos, of course; the other is stuck 
up on my wall as the chief of our sept.  Do you know any of the 
Gaelic-Celtic sharps? you might ask what the name means.  It 
puzzles me.  I find a M'STEIN and a MACSTEPHANE; and our own great-
grandfather always called himself Steenson, though he wrote it 
Stevenson.  There are at least three PLACES called Stevenson - 
STEVENSON in Cunningham, STEVENSON in Peebles, and STEVENSON in 
Haddington.  And it was not the Celtic trick, I understand, to call 
places after people.  I am going to write to Sir Herbert Maxwell 
about the name, but you might find some one.
</p><p>Get the Anglo-Saxon heresy out of your head; they superimposed 
their language, they scarce modified the race; only in Berwickshire 
and Roxburgh have they very largely affected the place names.  The 
Scandinavians did much more to Scotland than the Angles.  The 
Saxons didn't come.
</p><p>Enough of this sham antiquarianism.  Yes, it is in the matter of 
the book, of course, that collaboration shows; as for the manner, 
it is superficially all mine, in the sense that the last copy is 
all in my hand.  Lloyd did not even put pen to paper in the Paris 
scenes or the Barbizon scene; it was no good; he wrote and often 
rewrote all the rest; I had the best service from him on the 
character of Nares.  You see, we had been just meeting the man, and 
his memory was full of the man's words and ways.  And Lloyd is an 
impressionist, pure and simple.  The great difficulty of 
collaboration is that you can't explain what you mean.  I know what 
kind of effect I mean a character to give - what kind of TACHE he 
is to make; but how am I to tell my collaborator in words?  Hence 
it was necessary to say, 'Make him So-and-so'; and this was all 
right for Nares and Pinkerton and Loudon Dodd, whom we both knew, 
but for Bellairs, for instance - a man with whom I passed ten 
minutes fifteen years ago - what was I to say? and what could Lloyd 
do?  I, as a personal artist, can begin a character with only a 
haze in my head, but how if I have to translate the haze into words 
before I begin?  In our manner of collaboration (which I think the 
only possible - I mean that of one person being responsible, and 
giving the COUP DE POUCE to every part of the work) I was spared 
the obviously hopeless business of trying to explain to my 
collaborator what STYLE I wished a passage to be treated in.  These 
are the times that illustrate to a man the inadequacy of spoken 
language.  Now - to be just to written language - I can (or could) 
find a language for my every mood, but how could I TELL any one 
beforehand what this effect was to be, which it would take every 
art that I possessed, and hours and hours of deliberate labour and 
selection and rejection, to produce?  These are the impossibilities 
of collaboration.  Its immediate advantage is to focus two minds 
together on the stuff, and to produce in consequence an 
extraordinarily greater richness of purview, consideration, and 
invention.  The hardest chapter of all was 'Cross Questions and 
Crooked Answers.'  You would not believe what that cost us before 
it assumed the least unity and colour.  Lloyd wrote it at least 
thrice, and I at least five times - this is from memory.  And was 
that last chapter worth the trouble it cost?  Alas, that I should 
ask the question!  Two classes of men - the artist and the 
educationalist - are sworn, on soul and conscience, not to ask it.  
You get an ordinary, grinning, red-headed boy, and you have to 
educate him.  Faith supports you; you give your valuable hours, the 
boy does not seem to profit, but that way your duty lies, for which 
you are paid, and you must persevere.  Education has always seemed 
to me one of the few possible and dignified ways of life.  A 
sailor, a shepherd, a schoolmaster - to a less degree, a soldier - 
and (I don't know why, upon my soul, except as a sort of 
schoolmaster's unofficial assistant, and a kind of acrobat in 
tights) an artist, almost exhaust the category.
</p><p>If I had to begin again - I know not - SI JEUNESSE SAVAIT, SI 
VIEILLESSE POUVAIT . . . I know not at all - I believe I should try 
to honour Sex more religiously.  The worst of our education is that 
Christianity does not recognise and hallow Sex.  It looks askance 
at it, over its shoulder, oppressed as it is by reminiscences of 
hermits and Asiatic self-tortures.  It is a terrible hiatus in our 
modern religions that they cannot see and make venerable that which 
they ought to see first and hallow most.  Well, it is so; I cannot 
be wiser than my generation.
</p><p>But no doubt there is something great in the half-success that has 
attended the effort of turning into an emotional religion, Bald 
Conduct, without any appeal, or almost none, to the figurative, 
mysterious, and constitutive facts of life.  Not that conduct is 
not constitutive, but dear! it's dreary!  On the whole, conduct is 
better dealt with on the cast-iron 'gentleman' and duty formula, 
with as little fervour and poetry as possible; stoical and short.
</p><p>. . . There is a new something or other in the wind, which 
exercises me hugely:  anarchy, - I mean, anarchism.  People who 
(for pity's sake) commit dastardly murders very basely, die like 
saints, and leave beautiful letters behind 'em (did you see 
Vaillant to his daughter? it was the New Testament over again); 
people whose conduct is inexplicable to me, and yet their spiritual 
life higher than that of most.  This is just what the early 
Christians must have seemed to the Romans.  Is this, then, a new 
DRIVE among the monkeys?  Mind you, Bob, if they go on being 
martyred a few years more, the gross, dull, not unkindly bourgeois 
may get tired or ashamed or afraid of going on martyring; and the 
anarchists come out at the top just like the early Christians.  
That is, of course, they will step into power as a PERSONNEL, but 
God knows what they may believe when they come to do so; it can't 
be stranger or more improbable than what Christianity had come to 
be by the same time.
</p><p>Your letter was easily read, the pagination presented no 
difficulty, and I read it with much edification and gusto.  To look 
back, and to stereotype one bygone humour - what a hopeless thing!  
The mind runs ever in a thousand eddies like a river between 
cliffs.  You (the ego) are always spinning round in it, east, west, 
north, and south.  You are twenty years old, and forty, and five, 
and the next moment you are freezing at an imaginary eighty; you 
are never the plain forty-four that you should be by dates.  (The 
most philosophical language is the Gaelic, which has NO PRESENT 
TENSE - and the most useless.)  How, then, to choose some former 
age, and stick there?

</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, SEPTEMBER 10, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR SIR HERBERT MAXWELL, - I am emboldened by reading your very 
interesting Rhind Lectures to put to you a question:  What is my 
name, Stevenson?
</p><p>I find it in the forms Stevinetoun, Stevensoune, Stevensonne, 
Stenesone, Stewinsoune, M'Stein, and MacStephane.  My family, and 
(as far as I can gather) the majority of the inglorious clan, 
hailed from the borders of Cunningham and Renfrew, and the upper 
waters of the Clyde.  In the Barony of Bothwell was the seat of the 
laird Stevenson of Stevenson; but, as of course you know, there is 
a parish in Cunningham and places in Peebles and Haddington bearing 
the same name.
</p><p>If you can at all help me, you will render me a real service which 
I wish I could think of some manner to repay. - Believe me, yours 
truly,

that (for some obscure reason) Stevenson was a favourite alias with 
the M'Gregors.

</p><p>MY DEAR CUMMY, - So I hear you are ailing?  Think shame to 
yourself!  So you think there is nothing better to be done with 
time than that? and be sure we can all do much ourselves to decide 
whether we are to be ill or well! like a man on the gymnastic bars.  
We are all pretty well.  As for me, there is nothing the matter 
with me in the world, beyond the disgusting circumstance that I am 
not so young as once I was.  Lloyd has a gymnastic machine, and 
practises upon it every morning for an hour:  he is beginning to be 
a kind of young Samson.  Austin grows fat and brown, and gets on 
not so ill with his lessons, and my mother is in great price.  We 
are having knock-me-down weather for heat; I never remember it so 
hot before, and I fancy it means we are to have a hurricane again 
this year, I think; since we came here, we have not had a single 
gale of wind!  The Pacific is but a child to the North Sea; but 
when she does get excited, and gets up and girds herself, she can 
do something good.  We have had a very interesting business here.  
I helped the chiefs who were in prison; and when they were set 
free, what should they do but offer to make a part of my road for 
me out of gratitude?  Well, I was ashamed to refuse, and the trumps 
dug my road for me, and put up this inscription on a board:-

<p><b>Letter:  TO JAMES PAYN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, NOV. 4, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - I am asked to relate to you a little incident 
of domestic life at Vailima.  I had read your GLEAMS OF MEMORY, No. 
1; it then went to my wife, to Osbourne, to the cousin that is 
within my gates, and to my respected amanuensis, Mrs. Strong.  
Sunday approached.  In the course of the afternoon I was attracted 
to the great 'all - the winders is by Vanderputty, which upon 
entering I beheld a memorable scene.  The floor was bestrewn with 
the forms of midshipmen from the CURACOA - 'boldly say a wilderness 
of gunroom' - and in the midst of this sat Mrs. Strong throned on 
the sofa and reading aloud GLEAMS OF MEMORY.  They had just come 
the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete, 
and I had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its 
influence with inextinguishable laughter.  I thought this was not 
half bad for arthritic gout!  Depend upon it, sir, when I go into 
the arthritic gout business, I shall be done with literature, or at 
least with the funny business.  It is quite true I have my 
battlefields behind me.  I have done perhaps as much work as 
anybody else under the most deplorable conditions.  But two things 
fall to be noticed:  In the first place, I never was in actual 
pain; and in the second, I was never funny.  I'll tell you the 
worst day that I remember.  I had a haemorrhage, and was not 
allowed to speak; then, induced by the devil, or an errant doctor, 
I was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor 
inebriates - the castor-oil bowl.  Now, when castor-oil goes right, 
it is one thing; but when it goes wrong, it is another.  And it 
went WRONG with me that day.  The waves of faintness and nausea 
succeeded each other for twelve hours, and I do feel a legitimate 
pride in thinking that I stuck to my work all through and wrote a 
good deal of Admiral Guinea (which I might just as well not have 
written for all the reward it ever brought me) in spite of the 
barbarous bad conditions.  I think that is my great boast; and it 
seems a little thing alongside of your GLEAMS OF MEMORY illustrated 
by spasms of arthritic gout.  We really should have an order of 
merit in the trade of letters.  For valour, Scott would have had 
it; Pope too; myself on the strength of that castor-oil; and James 
Payn would be a Knight Commander.  The worst of it is, though Lang 
tells me you exhibit the courage of Huish, that not even an order 
can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business.  I have 
always said that there is nothing like pain; toothache, dumb-ague, 
arthritic gout, it does not matter what you call it, if the screw 
is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong, there is nothing left 
in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer.  Still, even 
to this there is the consolation that it cannot last for ever.  
Either you will be relieved and have a good hour again before the 
sun goes down, or else you will be liberated.  It is something 
after all (although not much) to think that you are leaving a brave 
example; that other literary men love to remember, as I am sure 
they will love to remember, everything about you - your sweetness, 
your brightness, your helpfulness to all of us, and in particular 
those one or two really adequate and noble papers which you have 
been privileged to write during these last years. - With the 
heartiest and kindest good-will, I remain, yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO LIEUTENANT EELES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, NOVEMBER 24, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR EELES, - The hand, as you will perceive (and also the 
spelling!), is Teuila's, but the scrannel voice is what remains of 
Tusitala's.  First of all, for business.  When you go to London you 
are to charter a hansom cab and proceed to the Museum.  It is 
particular fun to do this on Sundays when the Monument is shut up.  
Your cabman expostulates with you, you persist.  The cabman drives 
up in front of the closed gates and says, 'I told you so, sir.'  
You breathe in the porter's ears the mystic name of COLVIN, and he 
immediately unfolds the iron barrier.  You drive in, and doesn't 
your cabman think you're a swell.  A lord mayor is nothing to it.  
Colvin's door is the only one in the eastern gable of the building.  
Send in your card to him with 'From R. L. S.' in the corner, and 
the machinery will do the rest.  Henry James's address is 34 De 
Vere Mansions West.  I cannot remember where the place is; I cannot 
even remember on which side of the park.  But it's one of those big 
Cromwell Road-looking deserted thoroughfares out west in Kensington 
or Bayswater, or between the two; and anyway, Colvin will be able 
to put you on the direct track for Henry James.  I do not send 
formal introductions, as I have taken the liberty to prepare both 
of them for seeing you already.
</p><p>Hoskyn is staying with us.
</p><p>It is raining dismally.  The Curacoa track is hardly passable, but 
it must be trod to-morrow by the degenerate feet of their successor 
the Wallaroos.  I think it a very good account of these last that 
we don't think them either deformed or habitual criminals - they 
seem to be a kindly lot.
</p><p>The doctor will give you all the gossip.  I have preferred in this 
letter to stick to the strictly solid and necessary.  With kind 
messages from all in the house to all in the wardroom, all in the 
gunroom, and (may we dare to breathe it) to him who walks abaft, 
believe me, my dear Eeles, yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIR HERBERT MAXWELL</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 1, 1894.
</p><p>DEAR SIR HERBERT, - Thank you very much for your long and kind 
letter.  I shall certainly take your advice and call my cousin, the 
Lyon King, into council.  It is certainly a very interesting 
subject, though I don't suppose it can possibly lead to anything, 
this connection between the Stevensons and M'Gregors.  Alas! your 
invitation is to me a mere derision.  My chances of visiting Heaven 
are about as valid as my chances of visiting Monreith.  Though I 
should like well to see you, shrunken into a cottage, a literary 
Lord of Ravenscraig.  I suppose it is the inevitable doom of all 
those who dabble in Scotch soil; but really your fate is the more 
blessed.  I cannot conceive anything more grateful to me, or more 
amusing or more picturesque, than to live in a cottage outside your 
own park-walls. - With renewed thanks, believe me, dear Sir 
Herbert, yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO ANDREW LANG</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 1, 1894.
</p><p>MY DEAR LANG, - For the portrait of Braxfield, much thanks!  It is 
engraved from the same Raeburn portrait that I saw in '76 or '77 
with so extreme a gusto that I have ever since been Braxfield's 
humble servant, and am now trying, as you know, to stick him into a 
novel.  Alas! one might as well try to stick in Napoleon.  The 
picture shall be framed and hung up in my study.  Not only as a 
memento of you, but as a perpetual encouragement to do better with 
his Lordship.  I have not yet received the transcripts.  They must 
be very interesting.  Do you know, I picked up the other day an old 
LONGMAN'S, where I found an article of yours that I had missed, 
about Christie's?  I read it with great delight.  The year ends 
with us pretty much as it began, among wars and rumours of wars, 
and a vast and splendid exhibition of official incompetence. - 
Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 1, 1894.
</p><p>I AM afraid, MY DEAR WEG, that this must be the result of bribery 
and corruption!  The volume to which the dedication stands as 
preface seems to me to stand alone in your work; it is so natural, 
so personal, so sincere, so articulate in substance, and what you 
always were sure of - so rich in adornment.
</p><p>Let me speak first of the dedication.  I thank you for it from the 
heart.  It is beautifully said, beautifully and kindly felt; and I 
should be a churl indeed if I were not grateful, and an ass if I 
were not proud.  I remember when Symonds dedicated a book to me; I 
wrote and told him of 'the pang of gratified vanity' with which I 
had read it.  The pang was present again, but how much more sober 
and autumnal - like your volume.  Let me tell you a story, or 
remind you of a story.  In the year of grace something or other, 
anything between '76 and '78 I mentioned to you in my usual 
autobiographical and inconsiderate manner that I was hard up.  You 
said promptly that you had a balance at your banker's, and could 
make it convenient to let me have a cheque, and I accepted and got 
the money - how much was it? - twenty or perhaps thirty pounds?  I 
know not - but it was a great convenience.  The same evening, or 
the next day, I fell in conversation (in my usual autobiographical 
and . . . see above) with a denizen of the Savile Club, name now 
gone from me, only his figure and a dim three-quarter view of his 
face remaining.  To him I mentioned that you had given me a loan, 
remarking easily that of course it didn't matter to you.  Whereupon 
he read me a lecture, and told me how it really stood with you 
financially.  He was pretty serious; fearing, as I could not help 
perceiving, that I should take too light a view of the 
responsibility and the service (I was always thought too light - 
the irresponsible jester - you remember.  O, QUANTUM MUTATUS AB 
ILLO!)  If I remember rightly, the money was repaid before the end 
of the week - or, to be more exact and a trifle pedantic, the 
sennight - but the service has never been forgotten; and I send you 
back this piece of ancient history, CONSULE PLANCO, as a salute for 
your dedication, and propose that we should drink the health of the 
nameless one, who opened my eyes as to the true nature of what you 
did for me on that occasion.
</p><p>But here comes my Amanuensis, so we'll get on more swimmingly now.  
You will understand perhaps that what so particularly pleased me in 
the new volume, what seems to me to have so personal and original a 
note, are the middle-aged pieces in the beginning.  The whole of 
them, I may say, though I must own an especial liking to -
</p><p><br />
'I yearn not for the fighting fate,
That holds and hath achieved;
I live to watch and meditate
And dream - and be deceived.'
</p><p><br />
You take the change gallantly.  Not I, I must confess.  It is all 
very well to talk of renunciation, and of course it has to be done.  
But, for my part, give me a roaring toothache!  I do like to be 
deceived and to dream, but I have very little use for either 
watching or meditation.  I was not born for age.  And, curiously 
enough, I seem to see a contrary drift in my work from that which 
is so remarkable in yours.  You are going on sedately travelling 
through your ages, decently changing with the years to the proper 
tune.  And here am I, quite out of my true course, and with nothing 
in my foolish elderly head but love-stories.  This must repose upon 
some curious distinction of temperaments.  I gather from a phrase, 
boldly autobiographical, that you are - well, not precisely growing 
thin.  Can that be the difference?
</p><p>It is rather funny that this matter should come up just now, as I 
am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in 
one of my stories - 'The Justice-Clerk.'  The case is that of a 
woman, and I think that I am doing her justice.  You will be 
interested, I believe, to see the difference in our treatments.  
SECRETA VITAE, comes nearer to the case of my poor Kirstie.  Come 
to think of it, Gosse, I believe the main distinction is that you 
have a family growing up around you, and I am a childless, rather 
bitter, very clear-eyed, blighted youth.  I have, in fact, lost the 
path that makes it easy and natural for you to descend the hill.  I 
am going at it straight.  And where I have to go down it is a 
precipice.
</p><p>I must not forget to give you a word of thanks for AN ENGLISH 
VILLAGE.  It reminds me strongly of Keats, which is enough to say; 
and I was particularly pleased with the petulant sincerity of the 
concluding sentiment.
</p><p>Well, my dear Gosse, here's wishing you all health and prosperity, 
as well as to the mistress and the bairns.  May you live long, 
since it seems as if you would continue to enjoy life.  May you 
write many more books as good as this one - only there's one thing 
impossible, you can never write another dedication that can give 
the same pleasure to the vanished
</p><p>TUSITALA.
