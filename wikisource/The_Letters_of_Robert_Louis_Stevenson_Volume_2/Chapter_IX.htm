<p><b>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], AUGUST 1887.
</p><p>DEAR LAD, - I write to inform you that Mr. Stevenson's well-known 
work, VIRGINIBUS PUERISQUE, is about to be reprinted.  At the same 
time a second volume called MEMORIES AND PORTRAITS will issue from 
the roaring loom.  Its interest will be largely autobiographical, 
Mr. S. having sketched there the lineaments of many departed 
friends, and dwelt fondly, and with a m'istened eye, upon byegone 
pleasures.  The two will be issued under the common title of 
FAMILIAR ESSAYS; but the volumes will be vended separately to those 
who are mean enough not to hawk at both.
</p><p>The blood is at last stopped:  only yesterday.  I began to think I 
should not get away.  However, I hope - I hope - remark the word - 
no boasting - I hope I may luff up a bit now.  Dobell, whom I saw, 
gave as usual a good account of my lungs, and expressed himself, 
like his neighbours, hopefully about the trip.  He says, my uncle 
says, Scott says, Brown says - they all say - You ought not to be 
in such a state of health; you should recover.  Well, then, I mean 
to.  My spirits are rising again after three months of black 
depression:  I almost begin to feel as if I should care to live:  I 
would, by God!  And so I believe I shall. - Yours, BULLETIN 
M'GURDER.
</p><p>How has the Deacon gone?
</p>

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], August 6TH, 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - We - my mother, my wife, my stepson, my maidservant, 
and myself, five souls - leave, if all is well, Aug. 20th, per 
Wilson line SS. LUDGATE HILL.  Shall probably evade N. Y. at first, 
cutting straight to a watering-place:  Newport, I believe, its 
name.  Afterwards we shall steal incognito into LA BONNE VILLA, and 
see no one but you and the Scribners, if it may be so managed.  You 
must understand I have been very seedy indeed, quite a dead body; 
and unless the voyage does miracles, I shall have to draw it dam 
fine.  Alas, 'The Canoe Speaks' is now out of date; it will figure 
in my volume of verses now imminent.  However, I may find some 
inspiration some day. - Till very soon, yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>BOURNEMOUTH, AUGUST 19TH, 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE, - I promise you the paper-knife shall go to 
sea with me; and if it were in my disposal, I should promise it 
should return with me too.  All that you say, I thank you for very 
much; I thank you for all the pleasantness that you have brought 
about our house; and I hope the day may come when I shall see you 
again in poor old Skerryvore, now left to the natives of Canada, or 
to worse barbarians, if such exist.  I am afraid my attempt to jest 
is rather A CONTRE-COEUR.  Good-bye - AU REVOIR - and do not forget 
your friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO MESSRS. CHATTO AND WINDUS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>BOURNEMOUTH [AUGUST 1887].
</p><p>DEAR SIRS, - I here enclose the two titles.  Had you not better 
send me the bargains to sign?  I shall be here till Saturday; and 
shall have an address in London (which I shall send you) till 
Monday, when I shall sail.  Even if the proofs do not reach you 
till Monday morning, you could send a clerk from Fenchurch Street 
Station at 10.23 A.M. for Galleons Station, and he would find me 
embarking on board the LUDGATE HILL, Island Berth, Royal Albert 
Dock.  Pray keep this in case it should be necessary to catch this 
last chance.  I am most anxious to have the proofs with me on the 
voyage. - Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>H.M.S. 'VULGARIUM,'
OFF HAVRE DE GRACE, THIS 22ND DAY OF AUGUST [1887].
</p><p>SIR, - The weather has been hitherto inimitable.  Inimitable is the 
only word that I can apply to our fellow-voyagers, whom a 
categorist, possibly premature, has been already led to divide into 
two classes - the better sort consisting of the baser kind of 
Bagman, and the worser of undisguised Beasts of the Field.  The 
berths are excellent, the pasture swallowable, the champagne of H. 
James (to recur to my favourite adjective) inimitable.  As for the 
Commodore, he slept awhile in the evening, tossed off a cup of 
Henry James with his plain meal, walked the deck till eight, among 
sands and floating lights and buoys and wrecked brigantines, came 
down (to his regret) a minute too soon to see Margate lit up, 
turned in about nine, slept, with some interruptions, but on the 
whole sweetly, until six, and has already walked a mile or so of 
deck, among a fleet of other steamers waiting for the tide, within 
view of Havre, and pleasantly entertained by passing fishing-boats, 
hovering sea-gulls, and Vulgarians pairing on deck with endearments 
of primitive simplicity.  There, sir, can be viewed the sham 
quarrel, the sham desire for information, and every device of these 
two poor ancient sexes (who might, you might think, have learned in 
the course of the ages something new) down to the exchange of head-
gear. - I am, sir, yours,
</p><p>BOLD BOB BOLTSPRIT.
</p><p>B. B. B. (ALIAS the Commodore) will now turn to his proofs.  Havre 
de Grace is a city of some show.  It is for-ti-fied; and, so far as 
I can see, is a place of some trade.  It is situ-ated in France, a 
country of Europe.  You always complain there are no facts in my 
letters.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>NEWPORT, R. I. U.S.A. [SEPTEMBER 1887].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - So long it went excellent well, and I had a time 
I am glad to have had; really enjoying my life.  There is nothing 
like being at sea, after all.  And O, why have I allowed myself to 
rot so long on land?  But on the Banks I caught a cold, and I have 
not yet got over it.  My reception here was idiotic to the last 
degree....  It is very silly, and not pleasant, except where humour 
enters; and I confess the poor interviewer lads pleased me.  They 
are too good for their trade; avoided anything I asked them to 
avoid, and were no more vulgar in their reports than they could 
help.  I liked the lads.
</p><p>O, it was lovely on our stable-ship, chock full of stallions.  She 
rolled heartily, rolled some of the fittings out of our state-room, 
and I think a more dangerous cruise (except that it was summer) it 
would be hard to imagine.  But we enjoyed it to the masthead, all 
but Fanny; and even she perhaps a little.  When we got in, we had 
run out of beer, stout, cocoa, soda-water, water, fresh meat, and 
(almost) of biscuit.  But it was a thousandfold pleasanter than a 
great big Birmingham liner like a new hotel; and we liked the 
officers, and made friends with the quartermasters, and I (at 
least) made a friend of a baboon (for we carried a cargo of apes), 
whose embraces have pretty near cost me a coat.  The passengers 
improved, and were a very good specimen lot, with no drunkard, no 
gambling that I saw, and less grumbling and backbiting than one 
would have asked of poor human nature.  Apes, stallions, cows, 
matches, hay, and poor men-folk, all, or almost all, came 
successfully to land. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[NEWPORT, U.S.A., SEPTEMBER 1887.]
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES, - Here we are at Newport in the house of the good 
Fairchilds; and a sad burthen we have laid upon their shoulders.  I 
have been in bed practically ever since I came.  I caught a cold on 
the Banks after having had the finest time conceivable, and enjoyed 
myself more than I could have hoped on board our strange floating 
menagerie:  stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo; and 
the vast continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a 
haystack; and the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion, looking 
through the ports at our dinner-table, and winked when the crockery 
was broken; and the little monkeys stared at each other in their 
cages, and were thrown overboard like little bluish babies; and the 
big monkey, Jacko, scoured about the ship and rested willingly in 
my arms, to the ruin of my clothing; and the man of the stallions 
made a bower of the black tarpaulin, and sat therein at the feet of 
a raddled divinity, like a picture on a box of chocolates; and the 
other passengers, when they were not sick, looked on and laughed.  
Take all this picture, and make it roll till the bell shall sound 
unexpected notes and the fittings shall break lose in our state-
room, and you have the voyage of the LUDGATE HILL.  She arrived in 
the port of New York, without beer, porter, soda-water, curacoa, 
fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet we lived, and we regret her.
</p><p>My wife is a good deal run down, and I am no great shakes.
</p><p>America is, as I remarked, a fine place to eat in, and a great 
place for kindness; but, Lord, what a silly thing is popularity!  I 
envy the cool obscurity of Skerryvore.  If it even paid, said 
Meanness! and was abashed at himself. - Yours most sincerely,
</p><p>R. L S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[NEW YORK:  END OF SEPTEMBER 1887.]
</p><p>MY DEAR S. C., - Your delightful letter has just come, and finds me 
in a New York hotel, waiting the arrival of a sculptor (St. 
Gaudens) who is making a medallion of yours truly and who is (to 
boot) one of the handsomest and nicest fellows I have seen.  I 
caught a cold on the Banks; fog is not for me; nearly died of 
interviewers and visitors, during twenty-four hours in New York; 
cut for Newport with Lloyd and Valentine, a journey like fairy-land 
for the most engaging beauties, one little rocky and pine-shaded 
cove after another, each with a house and a boat at anchor, so that 
I left my heart in each and marvelled why American authors had been 
so unjust to their country; caught another cold on the train; 
arrived at Newport to go to bed and to grow worse, and to stay in 
bed until I left again; the Fairchilds proving during this time 
kindness itself; Mr. Fairchild simply one of the most engaging men 
in the world, and one of the children, Blair, AET. ten, a great joy 
and amusement in his solemn adoring attitude to the author of 
TREASURE ISLAND.
</p><p>Here I was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor.  I have 
begged him to make a medallion of himself and give me a copy.  I 
will not take up the sentence in which I was wandering so long, but 
begin fresh.  I was ten or twelve days at Newport; then came back 
convalescent to New York.  Fanny and Lloyd are off to the 
Adirondacks to see if that will suit; and the rest of us leave 
Monday (this is Saturday) to follow them up.  I hope we may manage 
to stay there all winter.  I have a splendid appetite and have on 
the whole recovered well after a mighty sharp attack.  I am now on 
a salary of 500 pounds a year for twelve articles in SCRIBNER'S 
MAGAZINE on what I like; it is more than 500 pounds, but I cannot 
calculate more precisely.  You have no idea how much is made of me 
here; I was offered 2000 pounds for a weekly article - eh heh! how 
is that? but I refused that lucrative job.  The success of 
UNDERWOODS is gratifying.  You see, the verses are sane; that is 
their strong point, and it seems it is strong enough to carry them.
</p><p>A thousand thanks for your grand letter, ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO W. E. HENLEY</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>NEW YORK [SEPTEMBER 1887]
</p><p>MY DEAR LAD, - Herewith verses for Dr. Hake, which please 
communicate.  I did my best with the interviewers; I don't know if 
Lloyd sent you the result; my heart was too sick:  you can do 
nothing with them; and yet - literally sweated with anxiety to 
please, and took me down in long hand!
</p><p>I have been quite ill, but go better.  I am being not busted, but 
medallioned, by St. Gaudens, who is a first-rate, plain, high-
minded artist and honest fellow; you would like him down to the 
ground.  I believe sculptors are fine fellows when they are not 
demons.  O, I am now a salaried person, 600 pounds a year, to write 
twelve articles in SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE; it remains to be seen if it 
really pays, huge as the sum is, but the slavery may overweigh me.  
I hope you will like my answer to Hake, and specially that he will.
</p><p>Love to all. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  To R. A. M. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, ADIRONDACKS, NEW YORK, U.S.A. [OCTOBER 1887].
</p><p>MY DEAR BOB, - The cold [of Colorado] was too rigorous for me; I 
could not risk the long railway voyage, and the season was too late 
to risk the Eastern, Cape Hatteras side of the steamer one; so here 
we stuck and stick.  We have a wooden house on a hill-top, 
overlooking a river, and a village about a quarter of a mile away, 
and very wooded hills; the whole scene is very Highland, bar want 
of heather and the wooden houses.
</p><p>I have got one good thing of my sea voyage:  it is proved the sea 
agrees heartily with me, and my mother likes it; so if I get any 
better, or no worse, my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month 
or so in summer.  Good Lord!  What fun!  Wealth is only useful for 
two things:  a yacht and a string quartette.  For these two I will 
sell my soul.  Except for these I hold that 700 pounds a year is as 
much as anybody can possibly want; and I have had more, so I know, 
for the extry coins were for no use, excepting for illness, which 
damns everything.
</p><p>I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have believed it 
possible.  We had the beastliest weather, and many discomforts; but 
the mere fact of its being a tramp-ship gave us many comforts; we 
could cut about with the men and officers, stay in the wheel-house, 
discuss all manner of things, and really be a little at sea.  And 
truly there is nothing else.  I had literally forgotten what 
happiness was, and the full mind - full of external and physical 
things, not full of cares and labours and rot about a fellow's 
behaviour.  My heart literally sang; I truly care for nothing so 
much as for that.  We took so north a course, that we saw 
Newfoundland; no one in the ship had ever seen it before.
</p><p>It was beyond belief to me how she rolled; in seemingly smooth 
water, the bell striking, the fittings bounding out of our state-
room.  It is worth having lived these last years, partly because I 
have written some better books, which is always pleasant, but 
chiefly to have had the joy of this voyage.  I have been made a lot 
of here, and it is sometimes pleasant, sometimes the reverse; but I 
could give it all up, and agree that - was the author of my works, 
for a good seventy ton schooner and the coins to keep her on.  And 
to think there are parties with yachts who would make the exchange!  
I know a little about fame now; it is no good compared to a yacht; 
and anyway there is more fame in a yacht, more genuine fame; to 
cross the Atlantic and come to anchor in Newport (say) with the 
Union Jack, and go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier, 
among the holiday yachtsmen - that's fame, that's glory, and nobody 
can take it away; they can't say your book is bad; you HAVE crossed 
the Atlantic.  I should do it south by the West Indies, to avoid 
the damned Banks; and probably come home by steamer, and leave the 
skipper to bring the yacht home.
</p><p>Well, if all goes well, we shall maybe sail out of Southampton 
water some of these days and take a run to Havre, and try the 
Baltic, or somewhere.
</p><p>Love to you all. - Ever your afft.,

<p><b>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, OCT. 8TH, 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I have just read your article twice, with cheers 
of approving laughter.  I do not believe you ever wrote anything so 
funny:  Tyndall's 'shell,' the passage on the Davos press and its 
invaluable issues, and that on V. Hugo and Swinburne, are 
exquisite; so, I say it more ruefully, is the touch about the 
doctors.  For the rest, I am very glad you like my verses so well; 
and the qualities you ascribe to them seem to me well found and 
well named.  I own to that kind of candour you attribute to me:  
when I am frankly interested, I suppose I fancy the public will be 
so too; and when I am moved, I am sure of it.  It has been my luck 
hitherto to meet with no staggering disillusion.  'Before' and 
'After' may be two; and yet I believe the habit is now too 
thoroughly ingrained to be altered.  About the doctors, you were 
right, that dedication has been the subject of some pleasantries 
that made me grind, and of your happily touched reproof which made 
me blush.  And to miscarry in a dedication is an abominable form of 
book-wreck; I am a good captain, I would rather lose the tent and 
save my dedication.
</p><p>I am at Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks, I suppose for the winter:  
it seems a first-rate place; we have a house in the eye of many 
winds, with a view of a piece of running water - Highland, all but 
the dear hue of peat - and of many hills - Highland also, but for 
the lack of heather.  Soon the snow will close on us; we are here 
some twenty miles - twenty-seven, they say, but this I profoundly 
disbelieve - in the woods; communication by letter is slow and (let 
me be consistent) aleatory; by telegram is as near as may be 
impossible.
</p><p>I had some experience of American appreciation; I liked a little of 
it, but there is too much; a little of that would go a long way to 
spoil a man; and I like myself better in the woods.  I am so damned 
candid and ingenuous (for a cynic), and so much of a 'cweatu' of 
impulse - aw' (if you remember that admirable Leech), that I begin 
to shirk any more taffy; I think I begin to like it too well.  But 
let us trust the Gods; they have a rod in pickle; reverently I doff 
my trousers, and with screwed eyes await the AMARI ALIQUID of the 
great God Busby.
</p><p>I thank you for the article in all ways, and remain yours 
affectionately,

</p><p>[SARANAC, OCTOBER 1887.]
</p><p>SIR,  - I have to trouble you with the following PAROLES BIEN 
SENTIES.  We are here at a first-rate place.  'Baker's' is the name 
of our house, but we don't address there; we prefer the tender care 
of the Post-Office, as more aristocratic (it is no use to telegraph 
even to the care of the Post-Office who does not give a single 
damn).  Baker's has a prophet's chamber, which the hypercritical 
might describe as a garret with a hole in the floor:  in that 
garret, sir, I have to trouble you and your wife to come and 
slumber.  Not now, however:  with manly hospitality, I choke off 
any sudden impulse.  Because first, my wife and my mother are gone 
(a note for the latter, strongly suspected to be in the hand of 
your talented wife, now sits silent on the mantel shelf), one to 
Niagara and t'other to Indianapolis.  Because, second, we are not 
yet installed.  And because third, I won't have you till I have a 
buffalo robe and leggings, lest you should want to paint me as a 
plain man, which I am not, but a rank Saranacker and wild man of 
the woods. - Yours,

</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, OCTOBER 1887.
</p><p>DEAR ARCHER, - Many thanks for the Wondrous Tale.  It is scarcely a 
work of genius, as I believe you felt.  Thanks also for your 
pencillings; though I defend 'shrew,' or at least many of the 
shrews.
</p><p>We are here (I suppose) for the winter in the Adirondacks, a hill 
and forest country on the Canadian border of New York State, very 
unsettled and primitive and cold, and healthful, or we are the more 
bitterly deceived.  I believe it will do well for me; but must not 
boast.
</p><p>My wife is away to Indiana to see her family; my mother, Lloyd, and 
I remain here in the cold, which has been exceeding sharp, and the 
hill air, which is inimitably fine.  We all eat bravely, and sleep 
well, and make great fires, and get along like one o'clock,
</p><p>I am now a salaried party; I am a BOURGEOIS now; I am to write a 
weekly paper for Scribner's, at a scale of payment which makes my 
teeth ache for shame and diffidence.  The editor is, I believe, to 
apply to you; for we were talking over likely men, and when I 
instanced you, he said he had had his eye upon you from the first.  
It is worth while, perhaps, to get in tow with the Scribners; they 
are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is always a 
pleasure to deal with them.  I am like to be a millionaire if this 
goes on, and be publicly hanged at the social revolution:  well, I 
would prefer that to dying in my bed; and it would be a godsend to 
my biographer, if ever I have one.  What are you about?  I hope you 
are all well and in good case and spirits, as I am now, after a 
most nefast experience of despondency before I left; but indeed I 
was quite run down.  Remember me to Mrs. Archer, and give my 
respects to Tom. - Yours very truly,

</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, OCTOBER 1887.]  I know not the day; but the month it 
is the drear October by the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - This is to say FIRST, the voyage was a huge 
success.  We all enjoyed it (bar my wife) to the ground:  sixteen 
days at sea with a cargo of hay, matches, stallions, and monkeys, 
and in a ship with no style on, and plenty of sailors to talk to, 
and the endless pleasures of the sea - the romance of it, the sport 
of the scratch dinner and the smashing crockery, the pleasure - an 
endless pleasure - of balancing to the swell:  well, it's over.
</p><p>SECOND, I had a fine time, rather a troubled one, at Newport and 
New York; saw much of and liked hugely the Fairchilds, St. Gaudens 
the sculptor, Gilder of the CENTURY - just saw the dear Alexander - 
saw a lot of my old and admirable friend Will Low, whom I wish you 
knew and appreciated - was medallioned by St. Gaudens, and at last 
escaped to
</p><p>THIRD, Saranac Lake, where we now are, and which I believe we mean 
to like and pass the winter at.  Our house - emphatically 'Baker's' 
- is on a hill, and has a sight of a stream turning a corner in the 
valley - bless the face of running water! - and sees some hills 
too, and the paganly prosaic roofs of Saranac itself; the Lake it 
does not see, nor do I regret that; I like water (fresh water I 
mean) either running swiftly among stones, or else largely 
qualified with whisky.  As I write, the sun (which has been long a 
stranger) shines in at my shoulder; from the next room, the bell of 
Lloyd's typewriter makes an agreeable music as it patters off (at a 
rate which astonishes this experienced novelist) the early chapters 
of a humorous romance; from still further off - the walls of 
Baker's are neither ancient nor massive - rumours of Valentine 
about the kitchen stove come to my ears; of my mother and Fanny I 
hear nothing, for the excellent reason that they have gone sparking 
off, one to Niagara, one to Indianapolis.  People complain that I 
never give news in my letters.  I have wiped out that reproach.
</p><p>But now, FOURTH, I have seen the article; and it may be from 
natural partiality, I think it the best you have written.  O - I 
remember the Gautier, which was an excellent performance; and the 
Balzac, which was good; and the Daudet, over which I licked my 
chops; but the R. L. S. is better yet.  It is so humorous, and it 
hits my little frailties with so neat (and so friendly) a touch; 
and Alan is the occasion for so much happy talk, and the quarrel is 
so generously praised.  I read it twice, though it was only some 
hours in my possession; and Low, who got it for me from the 
CENTURY, sat up to finish it ere he returned it; and, sir, we were 
all delighted.  Here is the paper out, nor will anything, not even 
friendship, not even gratitude for the article, induce me to begin 
a second sheet; so here with the kindest remembrances and the 
warmest good wishes, I remain, yours affectionately,

now.  I have played fast and loose with what I said to you; and 
that, I beg you to believe, in the purest innocence of mind.  I 
told you you should have the power over all my work in this 
country; and about a fortnight ago, when M'Clure was here, I calmly 
signed a bargain for the serial publication of a story.  You will 
scarce believe that I did this in mere oblivion; but I did; and all 
that I can say is that I will do so no more, and ask you to forgive 
me.  Please write to me soon as to this.
</p><p>Will you oblige me by paying in for three articles, as already 
sent, to my account with John Paton &amp; Co., 52 William Street?  This 
will be most convenient for us.
</p><p>The fourth article is nearly done; and I am the more deceived, or 
it is A BUSTER.
</p><p>Now as to the first thing in this letter, I do wish to hear from

harder to hear) any forgiveness; for I have deserved the worst. -

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC, NOVEMBER 1887.
</p><p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME, - I enclose corrected proof of BEGGARS, which 
seems good.  I mean to make a second sermon, which, if it is about 
the same length as PULVIS ET UMBRA, might go in along with it as 
two sermons, in which case I should call the first 'The Whole 
Creation,' and the second 'Any Good.'  We shall see; but you might 
say how you like the notion.
</p><p>One word:  if you have heard from Mr. Scribner of my unhappy 
oversight in the matter of a story, you will make me ashamed to 
write to you, and yet I wish to beg you to help me into quieter 
waters.  The oversight committed - and I do think it was not so bad 
as Mr. Scribner seems to think it-and discovered, I was in a 
miserable position.  I need not tell you that my first impulse was 
to offer to share or to surrender the price agreed upon when it 
should fall due; and it is almost to my credit that I arranged to 
refrain.  It is one of these positions from which there is no 
escape; I cannot undo what I have done.  And I wish to beg you - 
should Mr. Scribner speak to you in the matter - to try to get him 
to see this neglect of mine for no worse than it is:  unpardonable 
enough, because a breach of an agreement; but still pardonable, 
because a piece of sheer carelessness and want of memory, done, God 
knows, without design and since most sincerely regretted.  I have 
no memory.  You have seen how I omitted to reserve the American 
rights in JEKYLL:  last winter I wrote and demanded, as an 
increase, a less sum than had already been agreed upon for a story 
that I gave to Cassell's.  For once that my forgetfulness has, by a 
cursed fortune, seemed to gain, instead of lose, me money, it is 
painful indeed that I should produce so poor an impression on the 
mind of Mr. Scribner.  But I beg you to believe, and if possible to 
make him believe, that I am in no degree or sense a FAISEUR, and 
that in matters of business my design, at least, is honest.  Nor 
(bating bad memory and self-deception) am I untruthful in such 
affairs.
</p><p>If Mr. Scribner shall have said nothing to you in the matter, 
please regard the above as unwritten, and believe me, yours very 
truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME, - The revise seemed all right, so I did not 
trouble you with it; indeed, my demand for one was theatrical, to 
impress that obdurate dog, your reader.  Herewith a third paper:  
it has been a cruel long time upon the road, but here it is, and 
not bad at last, I fondly hope.  I was glad you liked the LANTERN 
BEARERS; I did, too.  I thought it was a good paper, really 
contained some excellent sense, and was ingeniously put together.  
I have not often had more trouble than I have with these papers; 
thirty or forty pages of foul copy, twenty is the very least I have 
had.  Well, you pay high; it is fit that I should have to work 
hard, it somewhat quiets my conscience. - Yours very truly,

<p><b>Letter:  TO J. A. SYMONDS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, ADIRONDACK MOUNTAINS, NEW YORK, U.S.A., NOVEMBER 21, 
1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR SYMONDS, - I think we have both meant and wanted to write 
to you any time these months; but we have been much tossed about, 
among new faces and old, and new scenes and old, and scenes (like 
this of Saranac) which are neither one nor other.  To give you some 
clue to our affairs, I had best begin pretty well back.  We sailed 
from the Thames in a vast bucket of iron that took seventeen days 
from shore to shore.  I cannot describe how I enjoyed the voyage, 
nor what good it did me; but on the Banks I caught friend catarrh.  
In New York and then in Newport I was pretty ill; but on my return 
to New York, lying in bed most of the time, with St. Gaudens the 
sculptor sculping me, and my old friend Low around, I began to pick 
up once more.  Now here we are in a kind of wilderness of hills and 
firwoods and boulders and snow and wooden houses.  So far as we 
have gone the climate is grey and harsh, but hungry and somnolent; 
and although not charming like that of Davos, essentially bracing 
and briskening.  The country is a kind of insane mixture of 
Scotland and a touch of Switzerland and a dash of America, and a 
thought of the British Channel in the skies.  We have a decent 
house -
</p><p>DECEMBER 6TH.
</p><p>- A decent house, as I was saying, sir, on a hill-top, with a look 
down a Scottish river in front, and on one hand a Perthshire hill; 
on the other, the beginnings and skirts of the village play hide 
and seek among other hills.  We have been below zero, I know not 
how far (10 at 8 A.M. once), and when it is cold it is delightful; 
but hitherto the cold has not held, and we have chopped in and out 
from frost to thaw, from snow to rain, from quiet air to the most 
disastrous north-westerly curdlers of the blood.  After a week of 
practical thaw, the ice still bears in favoured places.  So there 
is hope.
</p><p>I wonder if you saw my book of verses?  It went into a second 
edition, because of my name, I suppose, and its PROSE merits.  I do 
not set up to be a poet.  Only an all-round literary man:  a man 
who talks, not one who sings.  But I believe the very fact that it 
was only speech served the book with the public.  Horace is much a 
speaker, and see how popular! most of Martial is only speech, and I 
cannot conceive a person who does not love his Martial; most of 
Burns, also, such as 'The Louse,' 'The Toothache,' 'The Haggis,' 
and lots more of his best.  Excuse this little apology for my 
house; but I don't like to come before people who have a note of 
song, and let it be supposed I do not know the difference.
</p><p>To return to the more important - news.  My wife again suffers in 
high and cold places; I again profit.  She is off to-day to New 
York for a change, as heretofore to Berne, but I am glad to say in 
better case than then.  Still it is undeniable she suffers, and you 
must excuse her (at least) if we both prove bad correspondents.  I 
am decidedly better, but I have been terribly cut up with business 
complications:  one disagreeable, as threatening loss; one, of the 
most intolerable complexion, as involving me in dishonour.  The 
burthen of consistent carelessness:  I have lost much by it in the 
past; and for once (to my damnation) I have gained.  I am sure you 
will sympathise.  It is hard work to sleep; it is hard to be told 
you are a liar, and have to hold your peace, and think, 'Yes, by 
God, and a thief too!'  You remember my lectures on Ajax, or the 
Unintentional Sin?  Well, I know all about that now.  Nothing seems 
so unjust to the sufferer:  or is more just in essence.  LAISSEZ 
PASSER LA JUSTICE DE DIEU.
</p><p>Lloyd has learned to use the typewriter, and has most gallantly 
completed upon that the draft of a tale, which seems to me not 
without merit and promise, it is so silly, so gay, so absurd, in 
spots (to my partial eyes) so genuinely humorous.  It is true, he 
would not have written it but for the New Arabian Nights; but it is 
strange to find a young writer funny.  Heavens, but I was 
depressing when I took the pen in hand!  And now I doubt if I am 
sadder than my neighbours.  Will this beginner move in the inverse 
direction?

genuine affection, yours,

</p><p>SARANAC [DECEMBER 1887].
</p><p>MY DEAR LAD, - I was indeed overjoyed to hear of the Dumas.  In the 
matter of the dedication, are not cross dedications a little 
awkward?  Lang and Rider Haggard did it, to be sure.  Perpend.  And 
if you should conclude against a dedication, there is a passage in 
MEMORIES AND PORTRAITS written AT you, when I was most desperate 
(to stir you up a bit), which might be quoted:  something about 
Dumas still waiting his biographer.  I have a decent time when the 
weather is fine; when it is grey, or windy, or wet (as it too often 
is), I am merely degraded to the dirt.  I get some work done every 
day with a devil of a heave; not extra good ever; and I regret my 
engagement.  Whiles I have had the most deplorable business 
annoyances too; have been threatened with having to refund money; 
got over that; and found myself in the worse scrape of being a kind 
of unintentional swindler.  These have worried me a great deal; 
also old age with his stealing steps seems to have clawed me in his 
clutch to some tune.
</p><p>Do you play All Fours?  We are trying it; it is still all haze to 
me.  Can the elder hand BEG more than once?  The Port Admiral is at 
Boston mingling with millionaires.  I am but a weed on Lethe wharf.  
The wife is only so-so.  The Lord lead us all:  if I can only get 
off the stage with clean hands, I shall sing Hosanna.  'Put' is 
described quite differently from your version in a book I have; 
what are your rules?  The Port Admiral is using a game of put in a 
tale of his, the first copy of which was gloriously finished about 
a fortnight ago, and the revise gallantly begun:  THE FINSBURY 
TONTINE it is named, and might fill two volumes, and is quite 
incredibly silly, and in parts (it seems to me) pretty humorous. -

</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - The Opal is very well; it is fed with 
glycerine when it seems hungry.  I am very well, and get about much 
more than I could have hoped.  My wife is not very well; there is 
no doubt the high level does not agree with her, and she is on the 
move for a holiday to New York.  Lloyd is at Boston on a visit, and 
I hope has a good time.  My mother is really first-rate; she and I, 
despairing of other games for two, now play All Fours out of a 
gamebook, and have not yet discovered its niceties, if any.
</p><p>You will have heard, I dare say, that they made a great row over me 
here.  They also offered me much money, a great deal more than my 
works are worth:  I took some of it, and was greedy and hasty, and 
am now very sorry.  I have done with big prices from now out.  
Wealth and self-respect seem, in my case, to be strangers.
</p><p>We were talking the other day of how well Fleeming managed to grow 
rich.  Ah, that is a rare art; something more intellectual than a 
virtue.  The book has not yet made its appearance here; the life 
alone, with a little preface, is to appear in the States; and the 
Scribners are to send you half the royalties.  I should like it to 
do well, for Fleeming's sake.
</p><p>Will you please send me the Greek water-carrier's song?  I have a 
particular use for it.
</p><p>Have I any more news, I wonder? - and echo wonders along with me.  
I am strangely disquieted on all political matters; and I do not 
know if it is 'the signs of the times' or the sign of my own time 
of life.  But to me the sky seems black both in France and England, 
and only partly clear in America.  I have not seen it so dark in my 
time; of that I am sure.

for this long silence. - Very sincerely your friend,

and to hear more news of our beasts and birds and kindly fruits of 
earth and those human tenants who are (truly) too much with us.
</p><p>I am very well; better than for years:  that is for good.  But then 
my wife is no great shakes; the place does not suit her - it is my 
private opinion that no place does - and she is now away down to 
New York for a change, which (as Lloyd is in Boston) leaves my 
mother and me and Valentine alone in our wind-beleaguered hilltop 
hatbox of a house.  You should hear the cows butt against the walls 
in the early morning while they feed; you should also see our back 
log when the thermometer goes (as it does go) away - away below 
zero, till it can be seen no more by the eye of man - not the 
thermometer, which is still perfectly visible, but the mercury, 
which curls up into the bulb like a hibernating bear; you should 
also see the lad who 'does chores' for us, with his red stockings 
and his thirteen year old face, and his highly manly tramp into the 
room; and his two alternative answers to all questions about the 
weather:  either 'Cold,' or with a really lyrical movement of the 
voice, 'LOVELY - raining!'
</p><p>Will you take this miserable scarp for what it is worth?  Will you 
also understand that I am the man to blame, and my wife is really 
almost too much out of health to write, or at least doesn't write?

words to that effect), to say I am elected, and had better pay up a 
certain sum of money, I forget what.  Now I cannae verra weel draw 
a blank cheque and send to -
</p><p>LORD WARMINGPAN (or words to that effect),
London, England.
</p><p>And, man, if it was possible, I would be dooms glad to be out o' 
this bit scrapie.  Mebbe the club was ca'd  'The Union,' but I 
wouldnae like to sweir; and mebbe it wasnae, or mebbe only words to 
that effec' - but I wouldnae care just exac'ly about sweirin'.  Do 
ye no think Henley, or Pollick, or some o' they London fellies,

And that you would aiblins pay for me?  For I thocht I was sae dam

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS MONROE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, NEW YORK [DECEMBER 19, 1887].
</p><p>DEAR MISS MONROE, - Many thanks for your letter and your good 
wishes.  It was much my desire to get to Chicago:  had I done - or 
if I yet do - so, I shall hope to see the original of my 
photograph, which is one of my show possessions; but the fates are 
rather contrary.  My wife is far from well; I myself dread worse 
than almost any other imaginable peril, that miraculous and really 
insane invention the American Railroad Car.  Heaven help the man - 
may I add the woman - that sets foot in one!  Ah, if it were only 
an ocean to cross, it would be a matter of small thought to me - 
and great pleasure.  But the railroad car - every man has his weak 
point; and I fear the railroad car as abjectly as I do an earwig, 
and, on the whole, on better grounds.  You do not know how bitter 
it is to have to make such a confession; for you have not the 
pretension nor the weakness of a man.  If I do get to Chicago, you 
will hear of me:  so much can be said.  And do you never come east?
</p><p>I was pleased to recognise a word of my poor old Deacon in your 
letter.  It would interest me very much to hear how it went and 
what you thought of piece and actors; and my collaborator, who 
knows and respects the photograph, would be pleased too. - Still in 
the hope of seeing you, I am, yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, WINTER 1887-8.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - It may please you to know how our family has 
been employed.  In the silence of the snow the afternoon lamp has 
lighted an eager fireside group:  my mother reading, Fanny, Lloyd, 
and I devoted listeners; and the work was really one of the best 
works I ever heard; and its author is to be praised and honoured; 
and what do you suppose is the name of it? and have you ever read 
it yourself? and (I am bound I will get to the bottom of the page 
before I blow the gaff, if I have to fight it out on this line all 
summer; for if you have not to turn a leaf, there can be no 
suspense, the conspectory eye being swift to pick out proper names; 
and without suspense, there can be little pleasure in this world, 
to my mind at least) - and, in short, the name of it is RODERICK 
HUDSON, if you please.  My dear James, it is very spirited, and 
very sound, and very noble too.  Hudson, Mrs. Hudson, Rowland, O, 
all first-rate:  Rowland a very fine fellow; Hudson as good as he 
can stick (did you know Hudson?  I suspect you did), Mrs. H. his 
real born mother, a thing rarely managed in fiction.
</p><p>We are all keeping pretty fit and pretty hearty; but this letter is 
not from me to you, it is from a reader of R. H. to the author of 
the same, and it says nothing, and has nothing to say, but thank 
you.
</p><p>We are going to re-read CASAMASSIMA as a proper pendant.  Sir, I 
think these two are your best, and care not who knows it.
</p><p>May I beg you, the next time RODERICK is printed off, to go over 
the sheets of the last few chapters, and strike out 'immense' and 
'tremendous'?  You have simply dropped them there like your pocket-
handkerchief; all you have to do is to pick them up and pouch them, 
and your room - what do I say? - your cathedral! - will be swept 
and garnished. - I am, dear sir, your delighted reader,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - Perhaps it is a pang of causeless honesty, perhaps.  I hope 
it will set a value on my praise of RODERICK, perhaps it's a burst 
of the diabolic, but I must break out with the news that I can't 
bear the PORTRAIT OF A LADY.  I read it all, and I wept too; but I 
can't stand your having written it; and I beg you will write no 
more of the like.  INFRA, sir; Below you:  I can't help it - it may 
be your favourite work, but in my eyes it's BELOW YOU to write and 
me to read.  I thought RODERICK was going to be another such at the 
beginning; and I cannot describe my pleasure as I found it taking 
bones and blood, and looking out at me with a moved and human 
countenance, whose lineaments are written in my memory until my 
last of days.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>My wife begs your forgiveness; I believe for her silence.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE [DECEMBER 1887].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - This goes to say that we are all fit, and the 
place is very bleak and wintry, and up to now has shown no such 
charms of climate as Davos, but is a place where men eat and where 
the cattarh, catarrh (cattarrh, or cattarrhh) appears to be 
unknown.  I walk in my verandy in the snaw, sir, looking down over 
one of those dabbled wintry landscapes that are (to be frank) so 
chilly to the human bosom, and up at a grey, English - nay, 
MEHERCLE, Scottish - heaven; and I think it pretty bleak; and the 
wind swoops at me round the corner, like a lion, and fluffs the 
snow in my face; and I could aspire to be elsewhere; but yet I do 
not catch cold, and yet, when I come in, I eat.  So that hitherto 
Saranac, if not deliriously delectable, has not been a failure; 
nay, from the mere point of view of the wicked body, it has proved 
a success.  But I wish I could still get to the woods; alas, NOUS 
N'IRONS PLUS AU BOIS is my poor song; the paths are buried, the 
dingles drifted full, a little walk is grown a long one; till 
spring comes, I fear the burthen will hold good.
</p><p>I get along with my papers for SCRIBNER not fast, nor so far 
specially well; only this last, the fourth one (which makes a third 
part of my whole task), I do believe is pulled off after a fashion.  
It is a mere sermon:  'Smith opens out'; but it is true, and I find 
it touching and beneficial, to me at least; and I think there is 
some fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases.  
PULVIS ET UMBRA, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian 
Sermon, if I had wanted.  Its sentiments, although parsonic, will 
not offend even you, I believe.  The other three papers, I fear, 
bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine inspiration of an 
income at so much per essay, and the honest desire of the incomer 
to give good measure for his money.  Well, I did my damndest 
anyway.
</p><p>We have been reading H. James's RODERICK HUDSON, which I eagerly 
press you to get at once:  it is a book of a high order - the last 
volume in particular.  I wish Meredith would read it.  It took my 
breath away.
</p><p>I am at the seventh book of the AENEID, and quite amazed at its 
merits (also very often floored by its difficulties).  The Circe 
passage at the beginning, and the sublime business of Amata with 
the simile of the boy's top - O Lord, what a happy thought! - have 
specially delighted me. - I am, dear sir, your respected friend,

</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC, DECEMBER 24, 1887.]
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Thank you for your explanations.  I have done no 
more Virgil since I finished the seventh book, for I have, first 
been eaten up with Taine, and next have fallen head over heels into 
a new tale, THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE.  No thought have I now apart 
from it, and I have got along up to page ninety-two of the draft 
with great interest.  It is to me a most seizing tale:  there are 
some fantastic elements; the most is a dead genuine human problem - 
human tragedy, I should say rather.  It will be about as long, I 
imagine, as KIDNAPPED.
</p><p>DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
</p><p>(1) My old Lord Durrisdeer.
(2) The Master of Ballantrae, AND
(3) Henry Durie, HIS SONS.
(4) Clementina, ENGAGED TO THE FIRST, MARRIED TO THE SECOND.
(5) Ephraim Mackellar, LAND STEWARD AT DURRISDEER AND NARRATOR OF 
THE MOST OF THE BOOK.
(6) Francis Burke, Chevalier de St. Louis, ONE OF PRINCE CHARLIE'S 
IRISHMEN AND NARRATOR OF THE REST.
</p><p>Besides these, many instant figures, most of them dumb or nearly 
so:  Jessie Brown the whore, Captain Crail, Captain MacCombie, our 
old friend Alan Breck, our old friend Riach (both only for an 
instant), Teach the pirate (vulgarly Blackbeard), John Paul and 
Macconochie, servants at Durrisdeer.  The date is from 1745 to '65 
(about).  The scene, near Kirkcudbright, in the States, and for a 
little moment in the French East Indies.  I have done most of the 
big work, the quarrel, duel between the brothers, and announcement 
of the death to Clementina and my Lord - Clementina, Henry, and 
Mackellar (nicknamed Squaretoes) are really very fine fellows; the 
Master is all I know of the devil.  I have known hints of him, in 
the world, but always cowards; he is as bold as a lion, but with 
the same deadly, causeless duplicity I have watched with so much 
surprise in my two cowards.  'Tis true, I saw a hint of the same 
nature in another man who was not a coward; but he had other things 
to attend to; the Master has nothing else but his devilry.  Here 
come my visitors - and have now gone, or the first relay of them; 
and I hope no more may come.  For mark you, sir, this is our 'day' 
- Saturday, as ever was, and here we sit, my mother and I, before a 
large wood fire and await the enemy with the most steadfast 
courage; and without snow and greyness:  and the woman Fanny in New 
York for her health, which is far from good; and the lad Lloyd at 
the inn in the village because he has a cold; and the handmaid 
Valentine abroad in a sleigh upon her messages; and to-morrow 
Christmas and no mistake.  Such is human life:  LA CARRIERE 
HUMAINE.  I will enclose, if I remember, the required autograph.
</p><p>I will do better, put it on the back of this page.  Love to all, 
and mostly, my very dear Colvin, to yourself.  For whatever I say 
or do, or don't say or do, you may be very sure I am, - Yours 
always affectionately,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, ADIRONDACKS, N.Y., U.S.A., CHRISTMAS 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE, - And a very good Christmas to you all; and 
better fortune; and if worse, the more courage to support it - 
which I think is the kinder wish in all human affairs.  Somewhile - 
I fear a good while - after this, you should receive our Christmas 
gift; we have no tact and no taste, only a welcome and (often) 
tonic brutality; and I dare say the present, even after my friend 
Baxter has acted on and reviewed my hints, may prove a White 
Elephant.  That is why I dread presents.  And therefore pray 
understand if any element of that hamper prove unwelcome, IT IS TO 
BE EXCHANGED.  I will not sit down under the name of a giver of 
White Elephants.  I never had any elephant but one, and his 
initials were R. L. S.; and he trod on my foot at a very early age.  
But this is a fable, and not in the least to the point:  which is 
that if, for once in my life, I have wished to make things nicer 
for anybody but the Elephant (see fable), do not suffer me to have 
made them ineffably more embarrassing, and exchange - ruthlessly 
exchange! 
</p><p>For my part, I am the most cockered up of any mortal being; and one 
of the healthiest, or thereabout, at some modest distance from the 
bull's eye.  I am condemned to write twelve articles in SCRIBNER'S 
MAGAZINE for the love of gain; I think I had better send you them; 
what is far more to the purpose, I am on the jump with a new story 
which has bewitched me - I doubt it may bewitch no one else.  It is 
called THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE - pronounce Ballan-tray.  If it is 
not good, well, mine will be the fault; for I believe it is a good 
tale.
</p><p>The greetings of the season to you, and your mother, and your 
sisters.  My wife heartily joins. - And I am, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - You will think me an illiterate dog:  I am, for the first 
time, reading ROBERTSON'S SERMONS.  I do not know how to express 
how much I think of them.  If by any chance you should be as 
illiterate as I, and not know them, it is worth while curing the 
defect.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, JANUARY '88.
</p><p>DEAR CHARLES, - You are the flower of Doers. . . . Will my doer 
collaborate thus much in my new novel?  In the year 1794 or 5, Mr. 
Ephraim Mackellar, A.M., late. steward on the Durrisdeer estates, 
completed a set of memoranda (as long as a novel) with regard to 
the death of the (then) late Lord Durrisdeer, and as to that of his 
attainted elder brother, called by the family courtesy title the 
Master of Ballantrae.  These he placed in the hands of John 
Macbrair.  W.S., the family agent, on the understanding they were 
to be sealed until 1862, when a century would have elapsed since 
the affair in the wilderness (my lord's death).  You succeeded Mr. 
Macbrair's firm; the Durrisdeers are extinct; and last year, in an 
old green box, you found these papers with Macbrair's indorsation.  
It is that indorsation of which I want a copy; you may remember, 
when you gave me the papers, I neglected to take that, and I am 
sure you are a man too careful of antiquities to have let it fall 
aside.  I shall have a little introduction descriptive of my visit 
to Edinburgh, arrival there, denner with yoursel', and first 
reading of the papers in your smoking-room:  all of which, of 
course, you well remember. - Ever yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L S.
</p><p>Your name is my friend Mr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S.!!!

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC, WINTER 1887-8.
</p><p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME, - I am keeping the sermon to see if I can't 
add another.  Meanwhile, I will send you very soon a different 
paper which may take its place.  Possibly some of these days soon I 
may get together a talk on things current, which should go in (if 
possible) earlier than either.  I am now less nervous about these 
papers; I believe I can do the trick without great strain, though 
the terror that breathed on my back in the beginning is not yet 
forgotten.
</p><p>THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE I have had to leave aside, as I was quite 
worked out.  But in about a week I hope to try back and send you 
the first four numbers:  these are all drafted, it is only the 
revision that has broken me down, as it is often the hardest work.  
These four I propose you should set up for me at once, and we'll 
copyright 'em in a pamphlet.  I will tell you the names of the BONA 
FIDE purchasers in England.
</p><p>The numbers will run from twenty to thirty pages of my manuscript.  
You can give me that much, can you not?  It is a howling good tale 
- at least these first four numbers are; the end is a trifle more 
fantastic, but 'tis all picturesque.
</p><p>Don't trouble about any more French books; I am on another scent, 
you see, just now.  Only the FRENCH IN HINDUSTAN I await with 
impatience, as that is for BALLANTRAE.  The scene of that romance 
is Scotland - the States - Scotland - India - Scotland - and the 
States again; so it jumps like a flea.  I have enough about the 
States now, and very much obliged I am; yet if Drake's TRAGEDIES OF 
the WILDERNESS is (as I gather) a collection of originals, I should 
like to purchase it.  If it is a picturesque vulgarisation, I do 
not wish to look it in the face.  Purchase, I say; for I think it 
would be well to have some such collection by me with a view to 
fresh works. - Yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - If you think of having the MASTER illustrated, I suggest 
that Hole would be very well up to the Scottish, which is the 
larger part.  If you have it done here, tell your artist to look at 
the hall of Craigievar in Billing's BARONIAL AND ECCLESIASTICAL 
ANTIQUITIES, and he will get a broad hint for the hall at 
Durrisdeer:  it is, I think, the chimney of Craigievar and the roof 
of Pinkie, and perhaps a little more of Pinkie altogether; but I 
should have to see the book myself to be sure.  Hole would be 
invaluable for this.  I dare say if you had it illustrated, you 
could let me have one or two for the English edition.

<p><b>Letter:  TO WILLIAM ARCHER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC, WINTER 1887-8.]
</p><p>MY DEAR ARCHER, - What am I to say?  I have read your friend's book 
with singular relish.  If he has written any other, I beg you will 
let me see it; and if he has not, I beg him to lose no time in 
supplying the deficiency.  It is full of promise; but I should like 
to know his age.  There are things in it that are very clever, to 
which I attach small importance; it is the shape of the age.  And 
there are passages, particularly the rally in presence of the Zulu 
king, that show genuine and remarkable narrative talent - a talent 
that few will have the wit to understand, a talent of strength, 
spirit, capacity, sufficient vision, and sufficient self-sacrifice, 
which last is the chief point in a narrator.
</p><p>As a whole, it is (of course) a fever dream of the most feverish.  
Over Bashville the footman I howled with derision and delight; I 
dote on Bashville - I could read of him for ever; DE BASHVILLE JE 
SUIS LE FERVENT - there is only one Bashville, and I am his devoted 
slave; BASHVILLE EST MAGNIFIQUE, MAIS IL N'EST GUERE POSSIBLE.  He 
is the note of the book.  It is all mad, mad and deliriously 
delightful; the author has a taste in chivalry like Walter Scott's 
or Dumas', and then he daubs in little bits of socialism; he soars 
away on the wings of the romantic griffon - even the griffon, as he 
cleaves air, shouting with laughter at the nature of the quest - 
and I believe in his heart he thinks he is labouring in a quarry of 
solid granite realism.
</p><p>It is this that makes me - the most hardened adviser now extant - 
stand back and hold my peace.  If Mr. Shaw is below five-and-
twenty, let him go his path; if he is thirty, he had best be told 
that he is a romantic, and pursue romance with his eyes open; - or 
perhaps he knows it; - God knows! - my brain is softened.
</p><p>It is HORRID FUN.  All I ask is more of it.  Thank you for the 
pleasure you gave us, and tell me more of the inimitable author.
</p><p>(I say, Archer, my God, what women!) - Yours very truly,

</p><p>SARANAC, FEBRUARY 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR ARCHER, - Pretty sick in bed; but necessary to protest and 
continue your education.
</p><p>Why was Jenkin an amateur in my eyes?  You think because not 
amusing (I think he often was amusing).  The reason is this:  I 
never, or almost never, saw two pages of his work that I could not 
have put in one without the smallest loss of material.  That is the 
only test I know of writing.  If there is anywhere a thing said in 
two sentences that could have been as clearly and as engagingly and 
as forcibly said in one, then it's amateur work.  Then you will 
bring me up with old Dumas.  Nay, the object of a story is to be 
long, to fill up hours; the story-teller's art of writing is to 
water out by continual invention, historical and technical, and yet 
not seem to water; seem on the other hand to practise that same wit 
of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the proper art 
of writing.  That is one thing in which my stories fail:  I am 
always cutting the flesh off their bones.
</p><p>I would rise from the dead to preach!
</p><p>Hope all well.  I think my wife better, but she's not allowed to 
write; and this (only wrung from me by desire to Boss and Parsonise 
and Dominate, strong in sickness) is my first letter for days, and 
will likely be my last for many more.  Not blame my wife for her 
silence:  doctor's orders.  All much interested by your last, and 
fragment from brother, and anecdotes of Tomarcher. - The sick but 
still Moral

</p><p>MY DEAR ARCHER, - It happened thus.  I came forth from that 
performance in a breathing heat of indignation.  (Mind, at this 
distance of time and with my increased knowledge, I admit there is 
a problem in the piece; but I saw none then, except a problem in 
brutality; and I still consider the problem in that case not 
established.)  On my way down the FRANCAIS stairs, I trod on an old 
gentleman's toes, whereupon with that suavity that so well becomes 
me, I turned about to apologise, and on the instant, repenting me 
of that intention, stopped the apology midway, and added something 
in French to this effect:  No, you are one of the LACHES who have 
been applauding that piece.  I retract my apology.  Said the old 
Frenchman, laying his hand on my arm, and with a smile that was 
truly heavenly in temperance, irony, good-nature, and knowledge of

</p><p>This sudden return to an ancient favourite hangs upon an accident.  
The 'Franklin County Library' contains two works of his, THE 
CAVALIER and MORLEY ERNSTEIN.  I read the first with indescribable 
amusement - it was worse than I had feared, and yet somehow 
engaging; the second (to my surprise) was better than I had dared 
to hope:  a good honest, dull, interesting tale, with a genuine 
old-fashioned talent in the invention when not strained; and a 
genuine old-fashioned feeling for the English language.  This 
experience awoke appetite, and you see I have taken steps to stay 
it.

I write these to please you, not myself, and you know a main sight

another paper, and return the corrected proof of PULVIS ET UMBRA, 
so that we may be afloat.

BALLANTRAE shall be the name by all means.)  If you like and want 
it, I leave it to you to make an offer.  You may remember I thought 
the offer you made when I was still in England too small; by which 
I did not at all mean, I thought it less than it was worth, but too 
little to tempt me to undergo the disagreeables of serial 
publication.  This tale (if you want it) you are to have; for it is 
the least I can do for you; and you are to observe that the sum you 
pay me for my articles going far to meet my wants, I am quite open 
to be satisfied with less than formerly.  I tell you I do dislike 
this battle of the dollars.  I feel sure you all pay too much here 
in America; and I beg you not to spoil me any more.  For I am

degrees, it is really cold; and when the wind blows, O commend me 
to the result.  Pleasure in life is all delete; there is no red 
spot left, fires do not radiate, you burn your hands all the time 
on what seem to be cold stones.  It is odd, zero is like summer 
heat to us now; and we like, when the thermometer outside is really 
low, a room at about 48 degrees:  60 degrees we find oppressive.  
Yet the natives keep their holes at 90 degrees or even 100 degrees.
</p><p>This was interrupted days ago by household labours.  Since then I 
have had and (I tremble to write it, but it does seem as if I had) 
beaten off an influenza.  The cold is exquisite.  Valentine still 
in bed.  The proofs of the first part of the MASTER OF BALLANTRAE 
begin to come in; soon you shall have it in the pamphlet form; and 
I hope you will like it.  The second part will not be near so good; 
but there - we can but do as it'll do with us.  I have every reason 
to believe this winter has done me real good, so far as it has 
gone; and if I carry out my scheme for next winter, and succeeding 
years, I should end by being a tower of strength.  I want you to 
save a good holiday for next winter; I hope we shall be able to 
help you to some larks.  Is there any Greek Isle you would like to 
explore? or any creek in Asia Minor? - Yours ever affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, WINTER 1887-1888.]
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. CHARTERIS, - I have asked Douglas and Foulis to send 
you my last volume, so that you may possess my little paper on my 
father in a permanent shape; not for what that is worth, but as a 
tribute of respect to one whom my father regarded with such love, 
esteem, and affection.  Besides, as you will see, I have brought 
you under contribution, and I have still to thank you for your 
letter to my mother; so more than kind; in much, so just.  It is my 
hope, when time and health permit, to do something more definite 
for my father's memory.  You are one of the very few who can (if 
you will) help me.  Pray believe that I lay on you no obligation; I 
know too well, you may believe me, how difficult it is to put even 
two sincere lines upon paper, where all, too, is to order.  But if 
the spirit should ever move you, and you should recall something 
memorable of your friend, his son will heartily thank you for a 
note of it. - With much respect, believe me, yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, MARCH 1888.]
</p><p>MY DEAR DELIGHTFUL JAMES, - To quote your heading to my wife, I 
think no man writes so elegant a letter, I am sure none so kind, 
unless it be Colvin, and there is more of the stern parent about 
him.  I was vexed at your account of my admired Meredith:  I wish I 
could go and see him; as it is I will try to write.  I read with 
indescribable admiration your EMERSON.  I begin to long for the day 
when these portraits of yours shall be collected:  do put me in.  
But Emerson is a higher flight.  Have you a TOURGUENEFF?  You have 
told me many interesting things of him, and I seem to see them 
written, and forming a graceful and BILDEND sketch.  My novel is a 
tragedy; four parts out of six or seven are written, and gone to 
Burlingame.  Five parts of it are sound, human tragedy; the last 
one or two, I regret to say, not so soundly designed; I almost 
hesitate to write them; they are very picturesque, but they are 
fantastic; they shame, perhaps degrade, the beginning.  I wish I 
knew; that was how the tale came to me however.  I got the 
situation; it was an old taste of mine:  The older brother goes out 
in the '45, the younger stays; the younger, of course, gets title 
and estate and marries the bride designate of the elder - a family 
match, but he (the younger) had always loved her, and she had 
really loved the elder.  Do you see the situation?  Then the devil 
and Saranac suggested this DENOUEMENT, and I joined the two ends in 
a day or two of constant feverish thought, and began to write.  And 
now - I wonder if I have not gone too far with the fantastic?  The 
elder brother is an INCUBUS:  supposed to be killed at Culloden, he 
turns up again and bleeds the family of money; on that stopping he 
comes and lives with them, whence flows the real tragedy, the 
nocturnal duel of the brothers (very naturally, and indeed, I 
think, inevitably arising), and second supposed death of the elder.  
Husband and wife now really make up, and then the cloven hoof 
appears.  For the third supposed death and the manner of the third 
reappearance is steep; steep, sir.  It is even very steep, and I 
fear it shames the honest stuff so far; but then it is highly 
pictorial, and it leads up to the death of the elder brother at the 
hands of the younger in a perfectly cold-blooded murder, of which I 
wish (and mean) the reader to approve.  You see how daring is the 
design.  There are really but six characters, and one of these 
episodic, and yet it covers eighteen years, and will be, I imagine, 
the longest of my works. - Yours ever,

<p><b>Letter:  TO THE REV. DR. CHARTERIS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SARANAC LAKE, ADIRONDACKS, NEW YORK, U.S.A., SPRING 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR DR. CHARTERIS, - The funeral letter, your notes, and many 
other things, are reserved for a book, MEMORIALS OF A SCOTTISH 
FAMILY, if ever I can find time and opportunity.  I wish I could 
throw off all else and sit down to it to-day.  Yes, my father was a 
'distinctly religious man,' but not a pious.  The distinction 
painfully and pleasurably recalls old conflicts; it used to be my 
great gun - and you, who suffered for the whole Church, know how 
needful it was to have some reserve artillery!  His sentiments were 
tragic; he was a tragic thinker.  Now, granted that life is tragic 
to the marrow, it seems the proper function of religion to make us 
accept and serve in that tragedy, as officers in that other and 
comparable one of war.  Service is the word, active service, in the 
military sense; and the religious man - I beg pardon, the pious man 
- is he who has a military joy in duty - not he who weeps over the 
wounded.  We can do no more than try to do our best.  Really, I am 
the grandson of the manse - I preach you a kind of sermon.  Box the 
brat's ears!
</p><p>My mother - to pass to matters more within my competence - finely 
enjoys herself.  The new country, some new friends we have made, 
the interesting experiment of this climate-which (at least) is 
tragic - all have done her good.  I have myself passed a better 
winter than for years, and now that it is nearly over have some 
diffident hopes of doing well in the summer and 'eating a little 
more air' than usual.
</p><p>I thank you for the trouble you are taking, and my mother joins 
with me in kindest regards to yourself and Mrs. Charteris. - Yours 
very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, SPRING 1888.]
</p><p>DEAR MINISTER OF THE FREE KIRK AT PENICUIK, - For O, man, I cannae 
read your name! - That I have been so long in answering your 
delightful letter sits on my conscience badly.  The fact is I let 
my correspondence accumulate until I am going to leave a place; and 
then I pitch in, overhaul the pile, and my cries of penitence might 
be heard a mile about.  Yesterday I despatched thirty-five belated 
letters:  conceive the state of my conscience, above all as the 
Sins of Omission (see boyhood's guide, the Shorter Catechism) are 
in my view the only serious ones; I call it my view, but it cannot 
have escaped you that it was also Christ's.  However, all that is 
not to the purpose, which is to thank you for the sincere pleasure 
afforded by your charming letter.  I get a good few such; how few 
that please me at all, you would be surprised to learn - or have a 
singularly just idea of the dulness of our race; how few that 
please me as yours did, I can tell you in one word - NONE.  I am no 
great kirkgoer, for many reasons - and the sermon's one of them, 
and the first prayer another, but the chief and effectual reason is 
the stuffiness.  I am no great kirkgoer, says I, but when I read 
yon letter of yours, I thought I would like to sit under ye.  And 
then I saw ye were to send me a bit buik, and says I, I'll wait for 
the bit buik, and then I'll mebbe can read the man's name, and 
anyway I'll can kill twa birds wi' ae stane.  And, man! the buik 
was ne'er heard tell o'!
</p><p>That fact is an adminicle of excuse for my delay.
</p><p>And now, dear minister of the illegible name, thanks to you, and 
greeting to your wife, and may you have good guidance in your 
difficult labours, and a blessing on your life.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS FERRIER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, APRIL 1888.]
</p><p>MY DEAREST COGGIE, - I wish I could find the letter I began to you 
some time ago when I was ill; but I can't and I don't believe there 
was much in it anyway.  We have all behaved like pigs and beasts 
and barn-door poultry to you; but I have been sunk in work, and the 
lad is lazy and blind and has been working too; and as for Fanny, 
she has been (and still is) really unwell.  I had a mean hope you 
might perhaps write again before I got up steam:  I could not have 
been more ashamed of myself than I am, and I should have had 
another laugh.
</p><p>They always say I cannot give news in my letters:  I shall shake 
off that reproach.  On Monday, if she is well enough, Fanny leaves 
for California to see her friends; it is rather an anxiety to let 
her go alone; but the doctor simply forbids it in my case, and she 
is better anywhere than here - a bleak, blackguard, beggarly 
climate, of which I can say no good except that it suits me and 
some others of the same or similar persuasions whom (by all rights) 
it ought to kill.  It is a form of Arctic St. Andrews, I should 
imagine; and the miseries of forty degrees below zero, with a high 
wind, have to be felt to be appreciated.  The greyness of the 
heavens here is a circumstance eminently revolting to the soul; I 
have near forgot the aspect of the sun - I doubt if this be news; 
it is certainly no news to us.  My mother suffers a little from the 
inclemency of the place, but less on the whole than would be 
imagined.  Among other wild schemes, we have been projecting yacht 
voyages; and I beg to inform you that Cogia Hassan was cast for the 
part of passenger.  They may come off! - Again this is not news.  
The lad?  Well, the lad wrote a tale this winter, which appeared to 
me so funny that I have taken it in hand, and some of these days 
you will receive a copy of a work entitled 'A GAME OF BLUFF, by 
Lloyd Osbourne and Robert Louis Stevenson.'
</p><p>Otherwise he (the lad) is much as usual.  There remains, I believe, 
to be considered only R. L. S., the house-bond, prop, pillar, 
bread-winner, and bully of the establishment.  Well, I do think him 
much better; he is making piles of money; the hope of being able to 
hire a yacht ere long dances before his eyes; otherwise he is not 
in very high spirits at this particular moment, though compared 
with last year at Bournemouth an angel of joy.
</p><p>And now is this news, Cogia, or is it not?  It all depends upon the 
point of view, and I call it news.  The devil of it is that I can 
think of nothing else, except to send you all our loves, and to 
wish exceedingly you were here to cheer us all up.  But we'll see 
about that on board the yacht. - Your affectionate friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE], APRIL 9TH!! 1888
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I have been long without writing to you, but am 
not to blame, I had some little annoyances quite for a private eye, 
but they ran me so hard that I could not write without lugging them 
in, which (for several reasons) I did not choose to do.  Fanny is 
off to San Francisco, and next week I myself flit to New York:  
address Scribner's.  Where we shall go I know not, nor (I was going 
to say) care; so bald and bad is my frame of mind.  Do you know our 
- ahem! - fellow clubman, Colonel Majendie?  I had such an 
interesting letter from him.  Did you see my sermon?  It has evoked 
the worst feeling:  I fear people don't care for the truth, or else 
I don't tell it.  Suffer me to wander without purpose.  I have sent 
off twenty letters to-day, and begun and stuck at a twenty-first, 
and taken a copy of one which was on business, and corrected 
several galleys of proof, and sorted about a bushel of old letters; 
so if any one has a right to be romantically stupid it is I - and I 
am.  Really deeply stupid, and at that stage when in old days I 
used to pour out words without any meaning whatever and with my 
mind taking no part in the performance.  I suspect that is now the 
case.  I am reading with extraordinary pleasure the life of Lord 
Lawrence:  Lloyd and I have a mutiny novel -
</p><p>(NEXT MORNING, AFTER TWELVE OTHER LETTERS) - mutiny novel on hand - 
a tremendous work - so we are all at Indian books.  The idea of the 
novel is Lloyd's:  I call it a novel.  'Tis a tragic romance, of 
the most tragic sort:  I believe the end will be almost too much 
for human endurance - when the hero is thrown to the ground with 
one of his own (Sepoy) soldier's knees upon his chest, and the 
cries begin in the Beebeeghar.  O truly, you know it is a howler!  
The whole last part is - well the difficulty is that, short of 
resuscitating Shakespeare, I don't know who is to write it.
</p><p>I still keep wonderful.  I am a great performer before the Lord on 
the penny whistle.  Dear sir, sincerely yours,
</p><p>ANDREW JACKSON.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SARANAC LAKE, APRIL 1888.] ADDRESS C/O MESSRS. SCRIBNER'S SONS, 
743 BROADWAY, N.Y.
</p><p>MY DEAR GAMEKEEPER, - Your p. c. (proving you a good student of 
Micawber) has just arrived, and it paves the way to something I am 
anxious to say.  I wrote a paper the other day - PULVIS ET UMBRA; - 
I wrote it with great feeling and conviction:  to me it seemed 
bracing and healthful, it is in such a world (so seen by me), that 
I am very glad to fight out my battle, and see some fine sunsets, 
and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire.  
But I find that to some people this vision of mine is a nightmare, 
and extinguishes all ground of faith in God or pleasure in man.  
Truth I think not so much of; for I do not know it.  And I could 
wish in my heart that I had not published this paper, if it 
troubles folk too much:  all have not the same digestion, nor the 
same sight of things.  And it came over me with special pain that 
perhaps this article (which I was at the pains to send to her) 
might give dismalness to my GAMEKEEPER AT HOME.  Well, I cannot 
take back what I have said; but yet I may add this.  If my view be 
everything but the nonsense that it may be - to me it seems self-
evident and blinding truth - surely of all things it makes this 
world holier.  There is nothing in it but the moral side - but the 
great battle and the breathing times with their refreshments.  I 
see no more and no less.  And if you look again, it is not ugly, 
and it is filled with promise.
</p><p>Pray excuse a desponding author for this apology.  My wife is away 
off to the uttermost parts of the States, all by herself.  I shall 
be off, I hope, in a week; but where?  Ah! that I know not.  I keep 
wonderful, and my wife a little better, and the lad flourishing.  
We now perform duets on two D tin whistles; it is no joke to make 
the bass; I think I must really send you one, which I wish you 
would correct . . . I may be said to live for these instrumental 
labours now, but I have always some childishness on hand. - I am, 
dear Gamekeeper, your indulgent but intemperate Squire,

less), 'tis madness; but, of course, there is the hope, and I will

</p><p>DEAR HOMER ST. GAUDENS, - Your father has brought you this day to 
see me, and he tells me it is his hope you may remember the 
occasion.  I am going to do what I can to carry out his wish; and 
it may amuse you, years after, to see this little scrap of paper 
and to read what I write.  I must begin by testifying that you 
yourself took no interest whatever in the introduction, and in the 
most proper spirit displayed a single-minded ambition to get back 
to play, and this I thought an excellent and admirable point in 
your character.  You were also (I use the past tense, with a view 
to the time when you shall read, rather than to that when I am 
writing) a very pretty boy, and (to my European views) startlingly 
self-possessed.  My time of observation was so limited that you 
must pardon me if I can say no more:  what else I marked, what 
restlessness of foot and hand, what graceful clumsiness, what 
experimental designs upon the furniture, was but the common 
inheritance of human youth.  But you may perhaps like to know that 
the lean flushed man in bed, who interested you so little, was in a 
state of mind extremely mingled and unpleasant:  harassed with work 
which he thought he was not doing well, troubled with difficulties 
to which you will in time succeed, and yet looking forward to no 
less a matter than a voyage to the South Seas and the visitation of 
savage and desert islands. -Your father's friend,

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>MANASQUAN (AHEM!), NEW JERSEY, MAY 28TH, 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES, - With what a torrent it has come at last!  Up to 
now, what I like best is the first number of a LONDON LIFE.  You 
have never done anything better, and I don't know if perhaps you 
have ever done anything so good as the girl's outburst:  tip-top.  
I have been preaching your later works in your native land.  I had 
to present the Beltraffio volume to Low, and it has brought him to 
his knees; he was AMAZED at the first part of Georgina's Reasons, 
although (like me) not so well satisfied with Part II.  It is 
annoying to find the American public as stupid as the English, but 
they will waken up in time:  I wonder what they will think of TWO 
NATIONS? . .
</p><p>This, dear James, is a valedictory.  On June 15th the schooner 
yacht CASCO will (weather and a jealous providence permitting) 
steam through the Golden Gates for Honolulu, Tahiti, the Galapagos, 
Guayaquil, and - I hope NOT the bottom of the Pacific.  It will 
contain your obedient 'umble servant and party.  It seems too good 
to be true, and is a very good way of getting through the green-
sickness of maturity which, with all its accompanying ills, is now 
declaring itself in my mind and life.  They tell me it is not so 
severe as that of youth; if I (and the CASCO) are spared, I shall 
tell you more exactly, as I am one of the few people in the world 
who do not forget their own lives.
</p><p>Good-bye, then, my dear fellow, and please write us a word; we 
expect to have three mails in the next two months:  Honolulu, 
Tahiti, and Guayaquil.  But letters will be forwarded from 
Scribner's, if you hear nothing more definite directly.  In 3 
(three) days I leave for San Francisco. - Ever yours most 
cordially,
