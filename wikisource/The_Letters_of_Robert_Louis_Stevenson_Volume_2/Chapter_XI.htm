<p><br />
I WISH you to add to the words at the end of the prologue; they 
run, I think, thus, 'And this is the yarn of Loudon Dodd'; add, 
'not as he told, but as he wrote it afterwards for his diversion.'  
This becomes the more needful, because, when all is done, I shall 
probably revert to Tai-o-hae, and give final details about the 
characters in the way of a conversation between Dodd and Havers.  
These little snippets of information and FAITS-DIVERS have always a 
disjointed, broken-backed appearance; yet, readers like them.  In 
this book we have introduced so many characters, that this kind of 
epilogue will be looked for; and I rather hope, looking far ahead, 
that I can lighten it in dialogue.
</p><p>We are well past the middle now.  How does it strike you? and can 
you guess my mystery?  It will make a fattish volume!
</p><p>I say, have you ever read the HIGHLAND WIDOW?  I never had till 
yesterday:  I am half inclined, bar a trip or two, to think it 
Scott's masterpiece; and it has the name of a failure!  Strange 
things are readers.
</p><p>I expect proofs and revises in duplicate.
</p><p>We have now got into a small barrack at our place.  We see the sea 
six hundred feet below filling the end of two vales of forest.  On 
one hand the mountain runs above us some thousand feet higher; 
great trees stand round us in our clearing; there is an endless 
voice of birds; I have never lived in such a heaven; just now, I 
have fever, which mitigates but not destroys my gusto in my 
circumstances. - You may envy
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>. . . O, I don't know if I mentioned that having seen your new tail 
to the magazine, I cried off interference, at least for this trip.  
Did I ask you to send me my books and papers, and all the bound 
volumes of the mag.? QUORUM PARS.  I might add that were there a 
good book or so - new - I don't believe there is - such would be 
welcome.
</p><p>I desire - I positively begin to awake - to be remembered to 
Scribner, Low, St. Gaudens, Russell Sullivan.  Well, well, you 
fellows have the feast of reason and the flow of soul; I have a 
better-looking place and climate:  you should hear the birds on the 
hill now!  The day has just wound up with a shower; it is still 
light without, though I write within here at the cheek of a lamp; 
my wife and an invaluable German are wrestling about bread on the 
back verandah; and how the birds and the frogs are rattling, and 
piping, and hailing from the woods!  Here and there a throaty 
chuckle; here and there, cries like those of jolly children who 
have lost their way; here and there, the ringing sleigh-bell of the 
tree frog.  Out and away down below me on the sea it is still 
raining; it will be wet under foot on schooners, and the house will 
leak; how well I know that!  Here the showers only patter on the 
iron roof, and sometimes roar; and within, the lamp burns steady on 
the tafa-covered walls, with their dusky tartan patterns, and the 
book-shelves with their thin array of books; and no squall can rout 
my house or bring my heart into my mouth. - The well-pleased South 
Sea Islander,

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, DECEMBER 1890.]
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - By some diabolical accident, I have mislaid 
your last.  What was in it?  I know not, and here I am caught 
unexpectedly by the American mail, a week earlier than by 
computation.  The computation, not the mail, is supposed to be in 
error.  The vols. of SCRIBNER'S have arrived, and present a noble 
appearance in my house, which is not a noble structure at present.  
But by autumn we hope to be sprawling in our verandah, twelve feet, 
sir, by eighty-eight in front, and seventy-two on the flank; view 
of the sea and mountains, sunrise, moonrise, and the German fleet 
at anchor three miles away in Apia harbour.  I hope some day to 
offer you a bowl of kava there, or a slice of a pineapple, or some 
lemonade from my own hedge.  'I know a hedge where the lemons grow' 
- SHAKESPEARE.  My house at this moment smells of them strong; and 
the rain, which a while ago roared there, now rings in minute drops 
upon the iron roof.  I have no WRECKER for you this mail, other 
things having engaged me.  I was on the whole rather relieved you 
did not vote for regular papers, as I feared the traces.  It is my 
design from time to time to write a paper of a reminiscential 
(beastly word) description; some of them I could scarce publish 
from different considerations; but some of them - for instance, my 
long experience of gambling places - Homburg, Wiesbaden, Baden-
Baden, old Monaco, and new Monte Carlo - would make good magazine 
padding, if I got the stuff handled the right way.  I never could 
fathom why verse was put in magazines; it has something to do with 
the making-up, has it not?  I am scribbling a lot just now; if you 
are taken badly that way, apply to the South Seas.  I could send 
you some, I believe, anyway, only none of it is thoroughly ripe.  
If kept back the volume of ballads, I'll soon make it a respectable 
size if this fit continue.  By the next mail you may expect some 
more WRECKER, or I shall be displeased.  Probably no more than a 
chapter, however, for it is a hard one, and I am denuded of my 
proofs, my collaborator having walked away with them to England; 
hence some trouble in catching the just note.
</p><p>I am a mere farmer:  my talk, which would scarce interest you on 
Broadway, is all of fuafua and tuitui, and black boys, and planting 
and weeding, and axes and cutlasses; my hands are covered with 
blisters and full of thorns; letters are, doubtless, a fine thing, 
so are beer and skittles, but give me farmering in the tropics for 
real interest.  Life goes in enchantment; I come home to find I am 
late for dinner; and when I go to bed at night, I could cry for the 
weariness of my loins and thighs.  Do not speak to me of vexation, 
the life brims with it, but with living interest fairly.
</p><p>Christmas I go to Auckland, to meet Tamate, the New Guinea 
missionary, a man I love.  The rest of my life is a prospect of 
much rain, much weeding and making of paths, a little letters, and 
devilish little to eat. - I am, my dear Burlingame, with messages 
to all whom it may concern, very sincerely yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, APIA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 29TH, 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - It is terrible how little everybody writes, 
and how much of that little disappears in the capacious maw of the 
Post Office.  Many letters, both from and to me, I now know to have 
been lost in transit:  my eye is on the Sydney Post Office, a large 
ungainly structure with a tower, as being not a hundred miles from 
the scene of disappearance; but then I have no proof.  THE TRAGIC 
MUSE you announced to me as coming; I had already ordered it from a 
Sydney bookseller:  about two months ago he advised me that his 
copy was in the post; and I am still tragically museless.
</p><p>News, news, news.  What do we know of yours?  What do you care for 
ours?  We are in the midst of the rainy season, and dwell among 
alarms of hurricanes, in a very unsafe little two-storied wooden 
box 650 feet above and about three miles from the sea-beach.  
Behind us, till the other slope of the island, desert forest, 
peaks, and loud torrents; in front green slopes to the sea, some 
fifty miles of which we dominate.  We see the ships as they go out 
and in to the dangerous roadstead of Apia; and if they lie far out, 
we can even see their topmasts while they are at anchor.  Of sounds 
of men, beyond those of our own labourers, there reach us, at very 
long intervals, salutes from the warships in harbour, the bell of 
the cathedral church, and the low of the conch-shell calling the 
labour boys on the German plantations.  Yesterday, which was Sunday 
- the QUANTIEME is most likely erroneous; you can now correct it - 
we had a visitor - Baker of Tonga.  Heard you ever of him?  He is a 
great man here:  he is accused of theft, rape, judicial murder, 
private poisoning, abortion, misappropriation of public moneys - 
oddly enough, not forgery, nor arson:  you would be amused if you 
knew how thick the accusations fly in this South Sea world.  I make 
no doubt my own character is something illustrious; or if not yet, 
there is a good time coming.
</p><p>But all our resources have not of late been Pacific.  We have had 
enlightened society:  La Farge the painter, and your friend Henry 
Adams:  a great privilege - would it might endure.  I would go 
oftener to see them, but the place is awkward to reach on 
horseback.  I had to swim my horse the last time I went to dinner; 
and as I have not yet returned the clothes I had to borrow, I dare 
not return in the same plight:  it seems inevitable - as soon as 
the wash comes in, I plump straight into the American consul's 
shirt or trousers!  They, I believe, would come oftener to see me 
but for the horrid doubt that weighs upon our commissariat 
department; we have OFTEN almost nothing to eat; a guest would 
simply break the bank; my wife and I have dined on one avocado 
pear; I have several times dined on hard bread and onions.  What 
would you do with a guest at such narrow seasons? - eat him? or 
serve up a labour boy fricasseed?
</p><p>Work? work is now arrested, but I have written, I should think, 
about thirty chapters of the South Sea book; they will all want 
rehandling, I dare say.  Gracious, what a strain is a long book!  
The time it took me to design this volume, before I could dream of 
putting pen to paper, was excessive; and then think of writing a 
book of travels on the spot, when I am continually extending my 
information, revising my opinions, and seeing the most finely 
finished portions of my work come part by part in pieces.  Very 
soon I shall have no opinions left.  And without an opinion, how to 
string artistically vast accumulations of fact?  Darwin said no one 
could observe without a theory; I suppose he was right; 'tis a fine 
point of metaphysic; but I will take my oath, no man can write 
without one - at least the way he would like to, and my theories 
melt, melt, melt, and as they melt the thaw-waters wash down my 
writing, and leave unideal tracts - wastes instead of cultivated 
farms.
</p><p>Kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared 
since - ahem - I appeared.  He amazes me by his precocity and 
various endowment.  But he alarms me by his copiousness and haste.  
He should shield his fire with both hands 'and draw up all his 
strength and sweetness in one ball.'  ('Draw all his strength and 
all His sweetness up into one ball'?  I cannot remember Marvell's 
words.)  So the critics have been saying to me; but I was never 
capable of - and surely never guilty of - such a debauch of 
production.  At this rate his works will soon fill the habitable 
globe; and surely he was armed for better conflicts than these 
succinct sketches and flying leaves of verse?  I look on, I admire, 
I rejoice for myself; but in a kind of ambition we all have for our 
tongue and literature I am wounded.  If I had this man's fertility 
and courage, it seems to me I could heave a pyramid.
</p><p>Well, we begin to be the old fogies now; and it was high time 
SOMETHING rose to take our places.  Certainly Kipling has the 
gifts; the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening:  
what will he do with them?
</p><p>Goodbye, my dear James; find an hour to write to us, and register 
your letter. - Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>

<p><b>Letter:  TO RUDYARD KIPLING</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, 1891.]
</p><p>SIR, - I cannot call to mind having written you, but I am so throng 
with occupation this may have fallen aside.  I never heard tell I 
had any friends in Ireland, and I am led to understand you are come 
of no considerable family.  The gentleman I now serve with assures 
me, however, you are a very pretty fellow and your letter deserves 
to be remarked.  It's true he is himself a man of a very low 
descent upon the one side; though upon the other he counts 
cousinship with a gentleman, my very good friend, the late Mr. 
Balfour of the Shaws, in the Lothian; which I should be wanting in 
good fellowship to forget.  He tells me besides you are a man of 
your hands; I am not informed of your weapon; but if all be true it 
sticks in my mind I would be ready to make exception in your 
favour, and meet you like one gentleman with another.  I suppose 
this'll be your purpose in your favour, which I could very ill make 
out; it's one I would be sweir to baulk you of.  It seems, Mr. 
McIlvaine, which I take to be your name, you are in the household 
of a gentleman of the name of Coupling:  for whom my friend is very 
much engaged.  The distances being very uncommodious, I think it 
will be maybe better if we leave it to these two to settle all 
that's necessary to honour.  I would have you to take heed it's a 
very unusual condescension on my part, that bear a King's name; and 
for the matter of that I think shame to be mingled with a person of 
the name of Coupling, which is doubtless a very good house but one 
I never heard tell of, any more than Stevenson.  But your purpose 
being laudable, I would be sorry (as the word goes) to cut off my 
nose to spite my face. - I am, Sir, your humble servant,
</p><p>A. STEWART,
CHEVALIER DE ST. LOUIS.
</p><p>TO MR. M'ILVAINE,
GENTLEMAN PRIVATE IN A FOOT REGIMENT,
UNDER COVER TO MR. COUPLING.
</p><p>He has read me some of your Barrack Room Ballants, which are not of 
so noble a strain as some of mine in the Gaelic, but I could set 
some of them to the pipes if this rencounter goes as it's to be 
desired.  Let's first, as I understand you to move, do each other 
this rational courtesys; and if either will survive, we may grow 
better acquaint.  For your tastes for what's martial and for poetry 
agree with mine.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MARCEL SCHWOB</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SYDNEY, JANUARY 19th, 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR SIR, - SAPRISTI, COMME VOUS Y ALLEZ!  Richard III. and 
Dumas, with all my heart; but not Hamlet.  Hamlet is great 
literature; Richard III. a big, black, gross, sprawling melodrama, 
writ with infinite spirit but with no refinement or philosophy by a 
man who had the world, himself, mankind, and his trade still to 
learn.  I prefer the Vicomte de Bragelonne to Richard III.; it is 
better done of its kind:  I simply do not mention the Vicomte in 
the same part of the building with Hamlet, or Lear, or Othello, or 
any of those masterpieces that Shakespeare survived to give us.
</p><p>Also, COMME VOUS Y ALLEZ in my commendation!  I fear my SOLIDE 
EDUCATION CLASSIQUE had best be described, like Shakespeare's, as 
'little Latin and no Greek,' and I was educated, let me inform you, 
for an engineer.  I shall tell my bookseller to send you a copy of 
MEMORIES AND PORTRAITS, where you will see something of my descent 
and education, as it was, and hear me at length on my dear Vicomte.  
I give you permission gladly to take your choice out of my works, 
and translate what you shall prefer, too much honoured that so 
clever a young man should think it worth the pains.  My own choice 
would lie between KIDNAPPED and the MASTER OF BALLANTRAE.  Should 
you choose the latter, pray do not let Mrs. Henry thrust the sword 
up to the hilt in the frozen ground - one of my inconceivable 
blunders, an exaggeration to stagger Hugo.  Say 'she sought to 
thrust it in the ground.'  In both these works you should be 
prepared for Scotticisms used deliberately.
</p><p>I fear my stepson will not have found time to get to Paris; he was 
overwhelmed with occupation, and is already on his voyage back.  We 
live here in a beautiful land, amid a beautiful and interesting 
people.  The life is still very hard:  my wife and I live in a two-
roomed cottage, about three miles and six hundred and fifty feet 
above the sea; we have had to make the road to it; our supplies are 
very imperfect; in the wild weather of this (the hurricane) season 
we have much discomfort:  one night the wind blew in our house so 
outrageously that we must sit in the dark; and as the sound of the 
rain on the roof made speech inaudible, you may imagine we found 
the evening long.  All these things, however, are pleasant to me.  
You say L'ARTISTE INCONSCIENT set off to travel:  you do not divide 
me right.  0.6 of me is artist; 0.4, adventurer.  First, I suppose, 
come letters; then adventure; and since I have indulged the second 
part, I think the formula begins to change:  0.55 of an artist, 
0.45 of the adventurer were nearer true.  And if it had not been 
for my small strength, I might have been a different man in all 
things,
</p><p>Whatever you do, do not neglect to send me what you publish on 
Villon:  I look forward to that with lively interest.  I have no 
photograph at hand, but I will send one when I can.  It would be 
kind if you would do the like, for I do not see much chance of our 
meeting in the flesh:  and a name, and a handwriting, and an 
address, and even a style?  I know about as much of Tacitus, and 
more of Horace; it is not enough between contemporaries, such as we 
still are.  I have just remembered another of my books, which I re-
read the other day, and thought in places good - PRINCE OTTO.  It 
is not as good as either of the others; but it has one 
recommendation - it has female parts, so it might perhaps please 
better in France.
</p><p>I will ask Chatto to send you, then - PRINCE OTTO, MEMORIES AND 
PORTRAITS, UNDERWOODS, and BALLADS, none of which you seem to have 
seen.  They will be too late for the New Year:  let them be an 
Easter present.
</p><p>You must translate me soon; you will soon have better to do than to 
transverse the work of others. - Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON,

</p><p>SS. 'LUBECK,' AT SEA [ON THE RETURN VOYAGE FROM SYDNEY, MARCH 
1891].
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Perhaps in my old days I do grow irascible; 'the 
old man virulent' has long been my pet name for myself.  Well, the 
temper is at least all gone now; time is good at lowering these 
distemperatures; far better is a sharp sickness, and I am just (and 
scarce) afoot again after a smoking hot little malady at Sydney.  
And the temper being gone, I still think the same. . . .  We have 
not our parents for ever; we are never very good to them; when they 
go and we have lost our front-file man, we begin to feel all our 
neglects mighty sensibly.  I propose a proposal.  My mother is here 
on board with me; to-day for once I mean to make her as happy as I 
am able, and to do that which I know she likes.  You, on the other 
hand, go and see your father, and do ditto, and give him a real 
good hour or two.  We shall both be glad hereafter. - Yours ever,

<p><b>Letter:  TO H. B. BAILDON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, UPOLU [UNDATED, BUT WRITTEN IN 1891].
</p><p>MY DEAR BAILDON, - This is a real disappointment.  It was so long 
since we had met, I was anxious to see where time had carried and 
stranded us.  Last time we saw each other - it must have been all 
ten years ago, as we were new to the thirties - it was only for a 
moment, and now we're in the forties, and before very long we shall 
be in our graves.  Sick and well, I have had a splendid life of it, 
grudge nothing, regret very little - and then only some little 
corners of misconduct for which I deserve hanging, and must 
infallibly be damned - and, take it all over, damnation and all, 
would hardly change with any man of my time, unless perhaps it were 
Gordon or our friend Chalmers:  a man I admire for his virtues, 
love for his faults, and envy for the really A1 life he has, with 
everything heart - my heart, I mean - could wish.  It is curious to 
think you will read this in the grey metropolis; go the first grey, 
east-windy day into the Caledonian Station, if it looks at all as 
it did of yore:  I met Satan there.  And then go and stand by the 
cross, and remember the other one - him that went down - my 
brother, Robert Fergusson.  It is a pity you had not made me out, 
and seen me as patriarch and planter.  I shall look forward to some 
record of your time with Chalmers:  you can't weary me of that 
fellow, he is as big as a house and far bigger than any church, 
where no man warms his hands.  Do you know anything of Thomson?  Of 
A-, B-, C-, D-, E-, F-, at all?  As I write C.'s name mustard rises 
my nose; I have never forgiven that weak, amiable boy a little 
trick he played me when I could ill afford it:  I mean that 
whenever I think of it, some of the old wrath kindles, not that I 
would hurt the poor soul, if I got the world with it.  And Old X-?  
Is he still afloat?  Harmless bark!  I gather you ain't married 
yet, since your sister, to whom I ask to be remembered, goes with 
you.  Did you see a silly tale, JOHN NICHOLSON'S PREDICAMENT, or 
some such name, in which I made free with your home at Murrayfield?  
There is precious little sense in it, but it might amuse.  
Cassell's published it in a thing called YULE-TIDE years ago, and 
nobody that ever I heard of read or has ever seen YULE-TIDE.  It is 
addressed to a class we never met - readers of Cassell's series and 
that class of conscientious chaff, and my tale was dull, though I 
don't recall that it was conscientious.  Only, there's the house at 
Murrayfield and a dead body in it.  Glad the BALLADS amused you.  
They failed to entertain a coy public, at which I wondered, not 
that I set much account by my verses, which are the verses of 
Prosator; but I do know how to tell a yarn, and two of the yarns 
are great.  RAHERO is for its length a perfect folk-tale:  savage 
and yet fine, full of tailforemost morality, ancient as the granite 
rocks; if the historian, not to say the politician, could get that 
yarn into his head, he would have learned some of his A B C. But 
the average man at home cannot understand antiquity; he is sunk 
over the ears in Roman civilisation; and a tale like that of RAHERO 
falls on his ears inarticulate.  The SPECTATOR said there was no 
psychology in it; that interested me much:  my grandmother (as I 
used to call that able paper, and an able paper it is, and a fair 
one) cannot so much as observe the existence of savage psychology 
when it is put before it.  I am at bottom a psychologist and 
ashamed of it; the tale seized me one-third because of its 
picturesque features, two-thirds because of its astonishing 
psychology, and the SPECTATOR says there's none.  I am going on 
with a lot of island work, exulting in the knowledge of a new 
world, 'a new created world' and new men; and I am sure my income 
will DECLINE and FALL off; for the effort of comprehension is death 
to the intelligent public, and sickness to the dull.
</p><p>I do not know why I pester you with all this trash, above all as 
you deserve nothing.  I give you my warm TALOFA ('my love to you,' 
Samoan salutation).  Write me again when the spirit moves you.  And 
some day, if I still live, make out the trip again and let us hob-
a-nob with our grey pows on my verandah. - Yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. CRAIBE ANGUS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, APRIL 1891.
</p><p>DEAR MR. ANGUS, - Surely I remember you!  It was W. C. Murray who 
made us acquainted, and we had a pleasant crack.  I see your poet 
is not yet dead.  I remember even our talk - or you would not think 
of trusting that invaluable JOLLY BEGGARS to the treacherous posts, 
and the perils of the sea, and the carelessness of authors.  I love 
the idea, but I could not bear the risk.  However -
</p><p><br />
'Hale be your heart, hale be your fiddle - '
</p><p><br />
it was kindly thought upon.
</p><p>My interest in Burns is, as you suppose, perennial.  I would I 
could be present at the exhibition, with the purpose of which I 
heartily sympathise; but the NANCY has not waited in vain for me, I 
have followed my chest, the anchor is weighed long ago, I have said 
my last farewell to the hills and the heather and the lynns:  like 
Leyden, I have gone into far lands to die, not stayed like Burns to 
mingle in the end with Scottish soil.  I shall not even return like 
Scott for the last scene.  Burns Exhibitions are all over.  'Tis a 
far cry to Lochow from tropical Vailima.
</p><p><br />
'But still our hearts are true, our hearts are Highland,
And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.'
</p><p><br />
When your hand is in, will you remember our poor Edinburgh Robin?  
Burns alone has been just to his promise; follow Burns, he knew 
best, he knew whence he drew fire - from the poor, white-faced, 
drunken, vicious boy that raved himself to death in the Edinburgh 
madhouse.  Surely there is more to be gleaned about Fergusson, and 
surely it is high time the task was set about.  I way tell you 
(because your poet is not dead) something of how I feel:  we are 
three Robins who have touched the Scots lyre this last century.  
Well, the one is the world's, he did it, he came off, he is for 
ever; but I and the other - ah! what bonds we have - born in the 
same city; both sickly, both pestered, one nearly to madness, one 
to the madhouse, with a damnatory creed; both seeing the stars and 
the dawn, and wearing shoe-leather on the same ancient stones, 
under the same pends, down the same closes, where our common 
ancestors clashed in their armour, rusty or bright.  And the old 
Robin, who was before Burns and the flood, died in his acute, 
painful youth, and left the models of the great things that were to 
come; and the new, who came after, outlived his greensickness, and 
has faintly tried to parody the finished work.  If you will collect 
the strays of Robin Fergusson, fish for material, collect any last 
re-echoing of gossip, command me to do what you prefer - to write 
the preface - to write the whole if you prefer:  anything, so that 
another monument (after Burns's) be set up to my unhappy 
predecessor on the causey of Auld Reekie.  You will never know, nor 
will any man, how deep this feeling is:  I believe Fergusson lives 
in me.  I do, but tell it not in Gath; every man has these fanciful 
superstitions, coming, going, but yet enduring; only most men are 
so wise (or the poet in them so dead) that they keep their follies 
for themselves. - I am, yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, APRIL 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - I have to thank you and Mrs. Gosse for many 
mementoes, chiefly for your LIFE of your father.  There is a very 
delicate task, very delicately done.  I noted one or two 
carelessnesses, which I meant to point out to you for another 
edition; but I find I lack the time, and you will remark them for 
yourself against a new edition.  They were two, or perhaps three, 
flabbinesses of style which (in your work) amazed me.  Am I right 
in thinking you were a shade bored over the last chapters? or was 
it my own fault that made me think them susceptible of a more 
athletic compression?  (The flabbinesses were not there, I think, 
but in the more admirable part, where they showed the bigger.)  
Take it all together, the book struck me as if you had been hurried 
at the last, but particularly hurried over the proofs, and could 
still spend a very profitable fortnight in earnest revision and 
(towards the end) heroic compression.  The book, in design, 
subject, and general execution, is well worth the extra trouble.  
And even if I were wrong in thinking it specially wanted, it will 
not be lost; for do we not know, in Flaubert's dread confession, 
that 'prose is never done'?  What a medium to work in, for a man 
tired, perplexed among different aims and subjects, and spurred by 
the immediate need of 'siller'!  However, it's mine for what it's 
worth; and it's one of yours, the devil take it; and you know, as 
well as Flaubert, and as well as me, that it is NEVER DONE; in 
other words, it is a torment of the pit, usually neglected by the 
bards who (lucky beggars!) approached the Styx in measure.  I speak 
bitterly at the moment, having just detected in myself the last 
fatal symptom, three blank verses in succession - and I believe, 
God help me, a hemistich at the tail of them; hence I have deposed 
the labourer, come out of hell by my private trap, and now write to 
you from my little place in purgatory.  But I prefer hell:  would I 
could always dig in those red coals - or else be at sea in a 
schooner, bound for isles unvisited:  to be on shore and not to 
work is emptiness - suicidal vacancy.
</p><p>I was the more interested in your LIFE of your father, because I 
meditate one of mine, or rather of my family.  I have no such 
materials as you, and (our objections already made) your attack 
fills me with despair; it is direct and elegant, and your style is 
always admirable to me - lenity, lucidity, usually a high strain of 
breeding, an elegance that has a pleasant air of the accidental.  
But beware of purple passages.  I wonder if you think as well of 
your purple passages as I do of mine?  I wonder if you think as ill 
of mine as I do of yours?  I wonder; I can tell you at least what 
is wrong with yours - they are treated in the spirit of verse.  The 
spirit - I don't mean the measure, I don't mean you fall into 
bastard cadences; what I mean is that they seem vacant and smoothed 
out, ironed, if you like.  And in a style which (like yours) aims 
more and more successfully at the academic, one purple word is 
already much; three - a whole phrase - is inadmissible.  Wed 
yourself to a clean austerity:  that is your force.  Wear a linen 
ephod, splendidly candid.  Arrange its folds, but do not fasten it 
with any brooch.  I swear to you, in your talking robes, there 
should be no patch of adornment; and where the subject forces, let 
it force you no further than it must; and be ready with a twinkle 
of your pleasantry.  Yours is a fine tool, and I see so well how to 
hold it; I wonder if you see how to hold mine?  But then I am to 
the neck in prose, and just now in the 'dark INTERSTYLAR cave,' all 
methods and effects wooing me, myself in the midst impotent to 
follow any.  I look for dawn presently, and a full flowing river of 
expression, running whither it wills.  But these useless seasons, 
above all, when a man MUST continue to spoil paper, are infinitely 
weary.
</p><p>We are in our house after a fashion; without furniture, 'tis true, 
camping there, like the family after a sale.  But the bailiff has 
not yet appeared; he will probably come after.  The place is 
beautiful beyond dreams; some fifty miles of the Pacific spread in 
front; deep woods all round; a mountain making in the sky a profile 
of huge trees upon our left; about us, the little island of our 
clearing, studded with brave old gentlemen (or ladies, or 'the twa 
o' them') whom we have spared.  It is a good place to be in; night 
and morning, we have Theodore Rousseaus (always a new one) hung to 
amuse us on the walls of the world; and the moon - this is our good 
season, we have a moon just now - makes the night a piece of 
heaven.  It amazes me how people can live on in the dirty north; 
yet if you saw our rainy season (which is really a caulker for 
wind, wet, and darkness - howling showers, roaring winds, pit-
blackness at noon) you might marvel how we could endure that.  And 
we can't.  But there's a winter everywhere; only ours is in the 
summer.  Mark my words:  there will be a winter in heaven - and in 
hell.  CELA RENTRE DANS LES PROCEDES DU BON DIEU; ET VOUS VERREZ!  
There's another very good thing about Vailima, I am away from the 
little bubble of the literary life.  It is not all beer and 
skittles, is it?  By the by, my BALLADS seem to have been dam bad; 
all the crickets sing so in their crickety papers; and I have no 
ghost of an idea on the point myself:  verse is always to me the 
unknowable.  You might tell me how it strikes a professional bard:  
not that it really matters, for, of course, good or bad, I don't 
think I shall get into THAT galley any more.  But I should like to 
know if you join the shrill chorus of the crickets.  The crickets 
are the devil in all to you:  'tis a strange thing, they seem to 
rejoice like a strong man in their injustice.  I trust you got my 
letter about your Browning book.  In case it missed, I wish to say 
again that your publication of Browning's kind letter, as an 
illustration of HIS character, was modest, proper, and in radiant 
good taste. - In Witness whereof, etc., etc.,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS RAWLINSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, APIA, SAMOA, APRIL 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR MAY, - I never think of you by any more ceremonial name, so 
I will not pretend.  There is not much chance that I shall forget 
you until the time comes for me to forget all this little turmoil 
in a corner (though indeed I have been in several corners) of an 
inconsiderable planet.  You remain in my mind for a good reason, 
having given me (in so short a time) the most delightful pleasure.  
I shall remember, and you must still be beautiful.  The truth is, 
you must grow more so, or you will soon be less.  It is not so easy 
to be a flower, even when you bear a flower's name.  And if I 
admired you so much, and still remember you, it is not because of 
your face, but because you were then worthy of it, as you must 
still continue.
</p><p>Will you give my heartiest congratulations to Mr. S.?  He has my 
admiration; he is a brave man; when I was young, I should have run 
away from the sight of you, pierced with the sense of my unfitness.  
He is more wise and manly.  What a good husband he will have to be!  
And you - what a good wife!  Carry your love tenderly.  I will 
never forgive him - or you - it is in both your hands - if the face 
that once gladdened my heart should be changed into one sour or 
sorrowful.
</p><p>What a person you are to give flowers!  It was so I first heard of 
you; and now you are giving the May flower!
</p><p>Yes, Skerryvore has passed; it was, for us.  But I wish you could 
see us in our new home on the mountain, in the middle of great 
woods, and looking far out over the Pacific.  When Mr. S. is very 
rich, he must bring you round the world and let you see it, and see 
the old gentleman and the old lady.  I mean to live quite a long 
while yet, and my wife must do the same, or else I couldn't manage 
it; so, you see, you will have plenty of time; and it's a pity not 
to see the most beautiful places, and the most beautiful people 
moving there, and the real stars and moon overhead, instead of the 
tin imitations that preside over London.  I do not think my wife 
very well; but I am in hopes she will now have a little rest.  It 
has been a hard business, above all for her; we lived four months 
in the hurricane season in a miserable house, overborne with work, 
ill-fed, continually worried, drowned in perpetual rain, beaten 
upon by wind, so that we must sit in the dark in the evenings; and 
then I ran away, and she had a month of it alone.  Things go better 
now; the back of the work is broken; and we are still foolish 
enough to look forward to a little peace.  I am a very different 
person from the prisoner of Skerryvore.  The other day I was three-
and-twenty hours in an open boat; it made me pretty ill; but fancy 
its not killing me half-way!  It is like a fairy story that I 
should have recovered liberty and strength, and should go round 
again among my fellow-men, boating, riding, bathing, toiling hard 
with a wood-knife in the forest.  I can wish you nothing more 
delightful than my fortune in life; I wish it you; and better, if 
the thing be possible.
</p><p>Lloyd is tinkling below me on the typewriter; my wife has just left 
the room; she asks me to say she would have written had she been 
well enough, and hopes to do it still. - Accept the best wishes of 
your admirer,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, MAY 1891.]
</p><p>MY DEAR ADELAIDE, - I will own you just did manage to tread on my 
gouty toe; and I beg to assure you with most people I should simply 
have turned away and said no more.  My cudgelling was therefore in 
the nature of a caress or testimonial.
</p><p>God forbid, I should seem to judge for you on such a point; it was 
what you seemed to set forth as your reasons that fluttered my old 
Presbyterian spirit - for, mind you, I am a child of the 
Covenanters - whom I do not love, but they are mine after all, my 
father's and my mother's - and they had their merits too, and their 
ugly beauties, and grotesque heroisms, that I love them for, the 
while I laugh at them; but in their name and mine do what you think 
right, and let the world fall.  That is the privilege and the duty 
of private persons; and I shall think the more of you at the 
greater distance, because you keep a promise to your fellow-man, 
your helper and creditor in life, by just so much as I was tempted 
to think the less of you (O not much, or I would never have been 
angry) when I thought you were the swallower of a (tinfoil) 
formula.
</p><p>I must say I was uneasy about my letter, not because it was too 
strong as an expression of my unregenerate sentiments, but because 
I knew full well it should be followed by something kinder.  And 
the mischief has been in my health.  I fell sharply sick in Sydney, 
was put aboard the LUBECK pretty bad, got to Vailima, hung on a 
month there, and didn't pick up as well as my work needed; set off 
on a journey, gained a great deal, lost it again; and am back at 
Vailima, still no good at my necessary work.  I tell you this for 
my imperfect excuse that I should not have written you again sooner 
to remove the bad taste of my last.
</p><p>A road has been called Adelaide Road; it leads from the back of our 
house to the bridge, and thence to the garden, and by a bifurcation 
to the pig pen.  It is thus much traversed, particularly by Fanny.  
An oleander, the only one of your seeds that prospered in this 
climate, grows there; and the name is now some week or ten days 
applied and published.  ADELAIDE ROAD leads also into the bush, to 
the banana patch, and by a second bifurcation over the left branch 
of the stream to the plateau and the right hand of the gorges.  In 
short, it leads to all sorts of good, and is, besides, in itself a 
pretty winding path, bound downhill among big woods to the margin 
of the stream.
</p><p>What a strange idea, to think me a Jew-hater!  Isaiah and David and 
Heine are good enough for me; and I leave more unsaid.  Were I of 
Jew blood, I do not think I could ever forgive the Christians; the 
ghettos would get in my nostrils like mustard or lit gunpowder.  
Just so you as being a child of the Presbytery, I retain - I need 
not dwell on that.  The ascendant hand is what I feel most 
strongly; I am bound in and in with my forbears; were he one of 
mine, I should not be struck at all by Mr. Moss of Bevis Marks, I 
should still see behind him Moses of the Mount and the Tables and 
the shining face.  We are all nobly born; fortunate those who know 
it; blessed those who remember.
</p><p>I am, my dear Adelaide, most genuinely yours,

</p><p>Write by return to say you are better, and I will try to do the 
same.

</p><p>[VAILIMA], TUESDAY, 19TH MAY '91.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - I don't know what you think of me, not having 
written to you at all during your illness.  I find two sheets begun 
with your name, but that is no excuse. . . . I am keeping bravely; 
getting about better, every day, and hope soon to be in my usual 
fettle.  My books begin to come; and I fell once more on the Old 
Bailey session papers.  I have 1778, 1784, and 1786.  Should you be 
able to lay hands on any other volumes, above all a little later, I 
should be very glad you should buy them for me.  I particularly 
want ONE or TWO during the course of the Peninsular War.  Come to 
think, I ought rather to have communicated this want to Bain.  
Would it bore you to communicate to that effect with the great man?  
The sooner I have them, the better for me.  'Tis for Henry Shovel.  
But Henry Shovel has now turned into a work called 'The Shovels of 
Newton French:  Including Memoirs of Henry Shovel, a Private in the 
Peninsular War,' which work is to begin in 1664 with the marriage 
of Skipper, afterwards Alderman Shovel of Bristol, Henry's great-
great-grandfather, and end about 1832 with his own second marriage 
to the daughter of his runaway aunt.  Will the public ever stand 
such an opus?  Gude kens, but it tickles me.  Two or three 
historical personages will just appear:  Judge Jeffreys, 
Wellington, Colquhoun, Grant, and I think Townsend the runner.  I 
know the public won't like it; let 'em lump it then; I mean to make 
it good; it will be more like a saga. - Adieu, yours ever 
affectionately,

</p><p>VAILIMA [SUMMER 1891].
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - I find among my grandfather's papers his own 
reminiscences of his voyage round the north with Sir Walter, eighty 
years ago, LABUNTUR ANNI!  They are not remarkably good, but he was 
not a bad observer, and several touches seem to me speaking.  It 
has occurred to me you might like them to appear in the MAGAZINE.  
If you would, kindly let me know, and tell me how you would like it 
handled.  My grandad's MS. runs to between six and seven thousand 
words, which I could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch Sir 
W.  Would you like this done?  Would you like me to introduce the 
old gentleman?  I had something of the sort in my mind, and could 
fill a few columns rather A PROPOS.  I give you the first offer of 
this, according to your request; for though it may forestall one of 
the interests of my biography, the thing seems to me particularly 
suited for prior appearance in a magazine.

possible for me to write a preface here?  I will try if you like, 
if you think I must:  though surely there are Rivers in Assyria.  
Of course you will send me sheets of the catalogue; I suppose it 
(the preface) need not be long; perhaps it should be rather very 
short?  Be sure you give me your views upon these points.  Also 
tell me what names to mention among those of your helpers, and do 
remember to register everything, else it is not safe.
</p><p>The true place (in my view) for a monument to Fergusson were the 
churchyard of Haddington.  But as that would perhaps not carry many 
votes, I should say one of the two following sites:- First, either 
as near the site of the old Bedlam as we could get, or, second, 
beside the Cross, the heart of his city.  Upon this I would have a 
fluttering butterfly, and, I suggest, the citation,
</p><p><br />
Poor butterfly, thy case I mourn.
</p><p><br />
For the case of Fergusson is not one to pretend about.  A more 
miserable tragedy the sun never shone upon, or (in consideration of 
our climate) I should rather say refused to brighten. - Yours 
truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>Where Burns goes will not matter.  He is no local poet, like your 
Robin the First; he is general as the casing air.  Glasgow, as the 
chief city of Scottish men, would do well; but for God's sake, 
don't let it be like the Glasgow memorial to Knox:  I remember, 
when I first saw this, laughing for an hour by Shrewsbury clock.

</p><p>[VAILIMA, JUNE 19, 1891.]
</p><p>DEAR MR. IDE, - Herewith please find the DOCUMENT, which I trust 
will prove sufficient in law.  It seems to me very attractive in 
its eclecticism; Scots, English, and Roman law phrases are all 
indifferently introduced, and a quotation from the works of Haynes 
Bayly can hardly fail to attract the indulgence of the Bench. - 
Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I, Robert Louis Stevenson, Advocate of the Scots Bar, author of THE 
MASTER OF BALLANTRAE and MORAL EMBLEMS, stuck civil engineer, sole 
owner and patentee of the Palace and Plantation known as Vailima in 
the island of Upolu, Samoa, a British Subject, being in sound mind, 
and pretty well, I thank you, in body:
</p><p>In consideration that Miss Annie H. Ide, daughter of H. C. Ide, in 
the town of Saint Johnsbury, in the county of Caledonia, in the 
state of Vermont, United States of America, was born, out of all 
reason, upon Christmas Day, and is therefore out of all justice 
denied the consolation and profit of a proper birthday;
</p><p>And considering that I, the said Robert Louis Stevenson, have 
attained an age when O, we never mention it, and that I have now no 
further use for a birthday of any description;
</p><p>And in consideration that I have met H. C. Ide, the father of the

as I require:
</p><p>HAVE TRANSFERRED, and DO HEREBY TRANSFER, to the said Annie H. Ide, 
ALL AND WHOLE my rights and priviledges in the thirteenth day of 
November, formerly my birthday, now, hereby, and henceforth, the 
birthday of the said Annie H. Ide, to have, hold, exercise, and 
enjoy the same in the customary manner, by the sporting of fine 
raiment, eating of rich meats, and receipt of gifts, compliments, 
and copies of verse, according to the manner of our ancestors;
</p><p>AND I DIRECT the said Annie H. Ide to add to the said name of Annie 
H. Ide the name Louisa - at least in private; and I charge her to

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, OCTOBER 1891.]
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - From this perturbed and hunted being expect 
but a line, and that line shall be but a whoop for Adela.  O she's 
delicious, delicious; I could live and die with Adela - die, rather 
the better of the two; you never did a straighter thing, and never 
will.
</p><p>DAVID BALFOUR, second part of KIDNAPPED, is on the stocks at last; 
and is not bad, I think.  As for THE WRECKER, it's a machine, you 
know - don't expect aught else - a machine, and a police machine; 
but I believe the end is one of the most genuine butcheries in 
literature; and we point to our machine with a modest pride, as the 
only police machine without a villain.  Our criminals are a most 
pleasing crew, and leave the dock with scarce a stain upon their 
character.
</p><p>What a different line of country to be trying to draw Adela, and 
trying to write the last four chapters of THE WRECKER!  Heavens, 
it's like two centuries; and ours is such rude, transpontine 
business, aiming only at a certain fervour of conviction and sense 
of energy and violence in the men; and yours is so neat and bright 
and of so exquisite a surface!  Seems dreadful to send such a book 
to such an author; but your name is on the list.  And we do 
modestly ask you to consider the chapters on the NORAH CREINA with 
the study of Captain Nares, and the forementioned last four, with 
their brutality of substance and the curious (and perhaps unsound) 
technical manoeuvre of running the story together to a point as we 
go along, the narrative becoming more succinct and the details 
fining off with every page. - Sworn affidavit of
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>NO PERSON NOW ALIVE HAS BEATEN ADELA:  I ADORE ADELA AND HER MAKER.  
SIC SUBSCRIB.
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>A Sublime Poem to follow.
</p><p>Adela, Adela, Adela Chart,
What have you done to my elderly heart?
Of all the ladies of paper and ink
I count you the paragon, call you the pink.
The word of your brother depicts you in part:
'You raving maniac!' Adela Chart;
But in all the asylums that cumber the ground,
So delightful a maniac was ne'er to be found.
</p><p>I pore on you, dote on you, clasp you to heart,
I laud, love, and laugh at you, Adela Chart,
And thank my dear maker the while I admire
That I can be neither your husband nor sire.
</p><p>Your husband's, your sire's were a difficult part;
You're a byway to suicide, Adela Chart;
But to read of, depicted by exquisite James,
O, sure you're the flower and quintessence of dames.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p><br />
ERUCTAVIT COR MEUM.
</p><p><br />
My heart was inditing a goodly matter about Adela Chart.
Though oft I've been touched by the volatile dart,
To none have I grovelled but Adela Chart,
There are passable ladies, no question, in art -
But where is the marrow of Adela Chart?
I dreamed that to Tyburn I passed in the cart -
I dreamed I was married to Adela Chart:
From the first I awoke with a palpable start,
The second dumfoundered me, Adela Chart!
</p><p><br />
Another verse bursts from me, you see; no end to the violence of 
the Muse.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>OCTOBER 8TH, 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - All right, you shall have the TALES OF MY 
GRANDFATHER soon, but I guess we'll try and finish off THE WRECKER 
first.  A PROPOS of whom, please send some advanced sheets to 
Cassell's - away ahead of you - so that they may get a dummy out.
</p><p>Do you wish to illustrate MY GRANDFATHER?  He mentions as excellent 
a portrait of Scott by Basil Hall's brother.  I don't think I ever 
saw this engraved; would it not, if you could get track of it, 
prove a taking embellishment?  I suggest this for your 
consideration and inquiry.  A new portrait of Scott strikes me as 
good.  There is a hard, tough, constipated old portrait of my 
grandfather hanging in my aunt's house, Mrs. Alan Stevenson, 16 St. 
Leonard's Terrace, Chelsea, which has never been engraved - the 
better portrait, Joseph's bust has been reproduced, I believe, 
twice - and which, I am sure, my aunt would let you have a copy of.  
The plate could be of use for the book when we get so far, and thus 
to place it in the MAGAZINE might be an actual saving.
</p><p>I am swallowed up in politics for the first, I hope for the last, 
time in my sublunary career.  It is a painful, thankless trade; but 
one thing that came up I could not pass in silence.  Much drafting, 
addressing, deputationising has eaten up all my time, and again (to 
my contrition) I leave you Wreckerless.  As soon as the mail leaves 
I tackle it straight. - Yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

but I think it's going to be ready.  If I did not know you were on 
the stretch waiting for it and trembling for your illustrations, I 
would keep it for another finish; but things being as they are, I 
will let it go the best way I can get it.  I am now within two 
pages of the end of Chapter XXV., which is the last chapter, the 
end with its gathering up of loose threads, being the dedication to 
Low, and addressed to him:  this is my last and best expedient for 
the knotting up of these loose cards.  'Tis possible I may not get

another volume is out, please add that.  There is for a book-box.
</p><p>I hope you will like the end; I think it is rather strong meat.  I

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. CRAIBE ANGUS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, NOVEMBER 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR MR. ANGUS, - Herewith the invaluable sheets.  They came 
months after your letter, and I trembled; but here they are, and I 
have scrawled my vile name on them, and 'thocht shame' as I did it.  
I am expecting the sheets of your catalogue, so that I may attack 
the preface.  Please give me all the time you can.  The sooner the 
better; you might even send me early proofs as they are sent out, 
to give me more incubation.  I used to write as slow as judgment; 
now I write rather fast; but I am still 'a slow study,' and sit a 
long while silent on my eggs.  Unconscious thought, there is the 
only method:  macerate your subject, let it boil slow, then take 
the lid off and look in - and there your stuff is, good or bad.  
But the journalist's method is the way to manufacture lies; it is 
will-worship - if you know the luminous quaker phrase; and the will 
is only to be brought in the field for study, and again for 
revision.  The essential part of work is not an act, it is a state.
</p><p>I do not know why I write you this trash.
</p><p>Many thanks for your handsome dedication.  I have not yet had time 
to do more than glance at Mrs. Begg; it looks interesting. - Yours 
very truly,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ANNIE H. IDE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA [NOVEMBER 1891].
</p><p>MY DEAR LOUISA, - Your picture of the church, the photograph of 
yourself and your sister, and your very witty and pleasing letter, 
came all in a bundle, and made me feel I had my money's worth for 
that birthday.  I am now, I must be, one of your nearest relatives; 
exactly what we are to each other, I do not know, I doubt if the 
case has ever happened before - your papa ought to know, and I 
don't believe he does; but I think I ought to call you in the 
meanwhile, and until we get the advice of counsel learned in the 
law, my name-daughter.  Well, I was extremely pleased to see by the 
church that my name-daughter could draw; by the letter, that she 
was no fool; and by the photograph, that she was a pretty girl, 
which hurts nothing.  See how virtues are rewarded!  My first idea 
of adopting you was entirely charitable; and here I find that I am 
quite proud of it, and of you, and that I chose just the kind of 
name-daughter I wanted.  For I can draw too, or rather I mean to 
say I could before I forgot how; and I am very far from being a 
fool myself, however much I may look it; and I am as beautiful as 
the day, or at least I once hoped that perhaps I might be going to 
be.  And so I might.  So that you see we are well met, and peers on 
these important points.  I am VERY glad also that you are older 
than your sister.  So should I have been, if I had had one.  So 
that the number of points and virtues which you have inherited from 
your name-father is already quite surprising.
</p><p>I wish you would tell your father - not that I like to encourage my 
rival - that we have had a wonderful time here of late, and that 
they are having a cold day on Mulinuu, and the consuls are writing 
reports, and I am writing to the TIMES, and if we don't get rid of 
our friends this time I shall begin to despair of everything but my 
name-daughter.
</p><p>You are quite wrong as to the effect of the birthday on your age.  
From the moment the deed was registered (as it was in the public 
press with every solemnity), the 13th of November became your own 
AND ONLY birthday, and you ceased to have been born on Christmas 
Day.  Ask your father:  I am sure he will tell you this is sound 
law.  You are thus become a month and twelve days younger than you 
were, but will go on growing older for the future in the regular 
and human manner from one 13th November to the next.  The effect on 
me is more doubtful; I may, as you suggest, live for ever; I might, 
on the other hand, come to pieces like the one-horse shay at a 
moment's notice; doubtless the step was risky, but I do not the 
least regret that which enables me to sign myself your revered and 
delighted name-father,

</p><p>DEAR SIR, - Your obliging communication is to hand.  I am glad to 
find that you have read some of my books, and to see that you spell 
my name right.  This is a point (for some reason) of great 
difficulty; and I believe that a gentleman who can spell Stevenson 
with a v at sixteen, should have a show for the Presidency before 
fifty.  By that time

predict that you will have outgrown your taste for autographs, but 
perhaps your son may have inherited the collection, and on the

in the papers of 1921 (say) this letter may arouse a smile.
</p><p>Whatever you do, read something else besides novels and newspapers; 
the first are good enough when they are good; the second, at their 
best, are worth nothing.  Read great books of literature and 
history; try to understand the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages; be 
sure you do not understand when you dislike them; condemnation is 
non-comprehension.  And if you know something of these two periods, 
you will know a little more about to-day, and may be a good

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, DECEMBER 1891.]
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - The end of THE WRECKER having but just come 
in, you will, I dare say, be appalled to receive three (possibly 
four) chapters of a new book of the least attractive sort:  a 
history of nowhere in a corner, for no time to mention, running to 
a volume!  Well, it may very likely be an illusion; it is very 
likely no one could possibly wish to read it, but I wish to publish 
it.  If you don't cotton to the idea, kindly set it up at my 
expense, and let me know your terms for publishing.  The great 
affair to me is to have per return (if it might be) four or five - 
better say half a dozen - sets of the roughest proofs that can be 
drawn.  There are a good many men here whom I want to read the 
blessed thing, and not one would have the energy to read MS.  At 
the same time, if you care to glance at it, and have the time, I 
should be very glad of your opinion as to whether I have made any 
step at all towards possibly inducing folk at home to read matter 
so extraneous and outlandish.  I become heavy and owlish; years sit 
upon me; it begins to seem to me to be a man's business to leave 
off his damnable faces and say his say.  Else I could have made it 
pungent and light and lively.  In considering, kindly forget that I 
am R. L. S.; think of the four chapters as a book you are reading, 
by an inhabitant of our 'lovely but fatil' islands; and see if it 
could possibly amuse the hebetated public.  I have to publish 
anyway, you understand; I have a purpose beyond; I am concerned for 
some of the parties to this quarrel.  What I want to hear is from 
curiosity; what I want you to judge of is what we are to do with 
the book in a business sense.  To me it is not business at all; I 
had meant originally to lay all the profits to the credit of Samoa; 
when it comes to the pinch of writing, I judge this unfair - I give 
too much - and I mean to keep (if there be any profit at all) one-
half for the artisan; the rest I shall hold over to give to the 
Samoans FOR THAT WHICH I CHOOSE AND AGAINST WORK DONE.  I think I 
have never heard of greater insolence than to attempt such a 
subject; yet the tale is so strange and mixed, and the people so 
oddly charactered - above all, the whites - and the high note of 
the hurricane and the warships is so well prepared to take popular 
interest, and the latter part is so directly in the day's movement, 
that I am not without hope but some may read it; and if they don't, 
a murrain on them!  Here is, for the first time, a tale of Greeks - 
Homeric Greeks - mingled with moderns, and all true; Odysseus 
alongside of Rajah Brooke, PROPORTION GARDEE; and all true.  Here 
is for the first time since the Greeks (that I remember) the 
history of a handful of men, where all know each other in the eyes, 
and live close in a few acres, narrated at length, and with the 
seriousness of history.  Talk of the modern novel; here is a modern 
history.  And if I had the misfortune to found a school, the 
legitimate historian might lie down and die, for he could never 
overtake his material.  Here is a little tale that has not 'caret'-
ed its 'vates'; 'sacer' is another point.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>DECEMBER 7TH, 1891.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES, - Thanks for yours; your former letter was 
lost; so it appears was my long and masterly treatise on the TRAGIC 
MUSE.  I remember sending it very well, and there went by the same 
mail a long and masterly tractate to Gosse about his daddy's life, 
for which I have been long expecting an acknowledgment, and which 
is plainly gone to the bottom with the other.  If you see Gosse, 
please mention it.  These gems of criticism are now lost 
literature, like the tomes of Alexandria.  I could not do 'em 
again.  And I must ask you to be content with a dull head, a weary 
hand, and short commons, for to-day, as I am physically tired with 
hard work of every kind, the labours of the planter and the author 
both piled upon me mountain deep.  I am delighted beyond expression 
by Bourget's book:  he has phrases which affect me almost like 
Montaigne; I had read ere this a masterly essay of his on Pascal; 
this book does it; I write for all his essays by this mail, and 
shall try to meet him when I come to Europe.  The proposal is to 
pass a summer in France, I think in Royat, where the faithful could 
come and visit me; they are now not many.  I expect Henry James to 
come and break a crust or two with us.  I believe it will be only 
my wife and myself; and she will go over to England, but not I, or 
possibly incog. to Southampton, and then to Boscombe to see poor 
Lady Shelley.  I am writing - trying to write in a Babel fit for 
the bottomless pit; my wife, her daughter, her grandson and my 
mother, all shrieking at each other round the house - not in war, 
thank God! but the din is ultra martial, and the note of Lloyd 
joins in occasionally, and the cause of this to-do is simply cacao, 
whereof chocolate comes.  You may drink of our chocolate perhaps in 
five or six years from now, and not know it.  It makes a fine 
bustle, and gives us some hard work, out of which I have slunk for 
to-day.
</p><p>I have a story coming out:  God knows when or how; it answers to 
the name of the BEACH OF FALESA, and I think well of it.  I was 
delighted with the TRAGIC MUSE; I thought the Muse herself one of 
your best works; I was delighted also to hear of the success of 
your piece, as you know I am a dam failure, and might have dined 
with the dinner club that Daudet and these parties frequented.
</p><p>NEXT DAY.
</p><p>I have just been breakfasting at Baiae and Brindisi, and the charm 
of Bourget hag-rides me.  I wonder if this exquisite fellow, all 
made of fiddle-strings and scent and intelligence, could bear any 
of my bald prose.  If you think he could, ask Colvin to send him a 
copy of these last essays of mine when they appear; and tell 
Bourget they go to him from a South Sea Island as literal homage.  
I have read no new book for years that gave me the same literary 
thrill as his SENSATIONS D'ITALIE.  If (as I imagine) my cut-and-
dry literature would be death to him, and worse than death - 
journalism - be silent on the point.  For I have a great curiosity 
to know him, and if he doesn't know my work, I shall have the 
better chance of making his acquaintance.  I read THE PUPIL the 
other day with great joy; your little boy is admirable; why is 
there no little boy like that unless he hails from the Great 
Republic?
</p><p>Here I broke off, and wrote Bourget a dedication; no use resisting; 
it's a love affair.  O, he's exquisite, I bless you for the gift of 
him.  I have really enjoyed this book as I - almost as I - used to 
enjoy books when I was going twenty - twenty-three; and these are 
the years for reading!

</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA] JAN 2ND, '92.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - Overjoyed you were pleased with WRECKER, and 
shall consider your protests.  There is perhaps more art than you 
think for in the peccant chapter, where I have succeeded in packing 
into one a dedication, an explanation, and a termination.  Surely 
you had not recognised the phrase about boodle?  It was a quotation 
from Jim Pinkerton, and seemed to me agreeably skittish.  However, 
all shall be prayerfully considered.
</p><p>To come to a more painful subject.  Herewith go three more chapters 
of the wretched HISTORY; as you see, I approach the climax.  I 
expect the book to be some 70,000 words, of which you have now 45.  
Can I finish it for next mail?  I am going to try!  'Tis a long 
piece of journalism, and full of difficulties here and there, of 
this kind and that, and will make me a power of friends to be sure.  
There is one Becker who will probably put up a window to me in the 
church where he was baptized; and I expect a testimonial from 
Captain Hand.
</p><p>Sorry to let the mail go without the Scott; this has been a bad 
month with me, and I have been below myself.  I shall find a way to 
have it come by next, or know the reason why.  The mail after, 
anyway.
</p><p>A bit of a sketch map appears to me necessary for my HISTORY; 
perhaps two.  If I do not have any, 'tis impossible any one should 
follow; and I, even when not at all interested, demand that I shall 
be able to follow; even a tourist book without a map is a cross to 
me; and there must be others of my way of thinking.  I inclose the 
very artless one that I think needful.  Vailima, in case you are 
curious, is about as far again behind Tanugamanono as that is from 
the sea.
</p><p>M'Clure is publishing a short story of mine, some 50,000 words, I 
think, THE BEACH OF FALESA; when he's done with it, I want you and 
Cassell to bring it out in a little volume; I shall send you a 
dedication for it; I believe it good; indeed, to be honest, very 
good.  Good gear that pleases the merchant.
</p><p>The other map that I half threaten is a chart for the hurricane.  
Get me Kimberley's report of the hurricane:  not to be found here.  
It is of most importance; I MUST have it with my proofs of that 
part, if I cannot have it earlier, which now seems impossible. - 
Yours in hot haste,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, FEBRUARY 1892.
</p><p>DEAR MR. BARRIE, - This is at least the third letter I have written 
you, but my correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as 
the post.  That which I possess of manhood turns pale before the 
business of the address and envelope.  But I hope to be more 
fortunate with this:  for, besides the usual and often recurrent 
desire to thank you for your work-you are one of four that have 
come to the front since I was watching and had a corner of my own 
to watch, and there is no reason, unless it be in these mysterious 
tides that ebb and flow, and make and mar and murder the works of 
poor scribblers, why you should not do work of the best order.  The 
tides have borne away my sentence, of which I was weary at any 
rate, and between authors I may allow myself so much freedom as to 
leave it pending.  We are both Scots besides, and I suspect both 
rather Scotty Scots; my own Scotchness tends to intermittency, but 
is at times erisypelitous - if that be rightly spelt.  Lastly, I 
have gathered we had both made our stages in the metropolis of the 
winds:  our Virgil's 'grey metropolis,' and I count that a lasting 
bond.  No place so brands a man.
</p><p>Finally, I feel it a sort of duty to you to report progress.  This 
may be an error, but I believed I detected your hand in an article 
- it may be an illusion, it may have been by one of those 
industrious insects who catch up and reproduce the handling of each 
emergent man - but I'll still hope it was yours - and hope it may 
please you to hear that the continuation of KIDNAPPED is under way.  
I have not yet got to Alan, so I do not know if he is still alive, 
but David seems to have a kick or two in his shanks.  I was pleased 
to see how the Anglo-Saxon theory fell into the trap:  I gave my 
Lowlander a Gaelic name, and even commented on the fact in the 
text; yet almost all critics recognised in Alan and David a Saxon 
and a Celt.  I know not about England; in Scotland at least, where 
Gaelic was spoken in Fife little over the century ago, and in 
Galloway not much earlier, I deny that there exists such a thing as 
a pure Saxon, and I think it more than questionable if there be 
such a thing as a pure Celt.
</p><p>But what have you to do with this? and what have I?  Let us 
continue to inscribe our little bits of tales, and let the heathen 
rage!  Yours, with sincere interest in your career,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO WILLIAM MORRIS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, FEB. 1892.
</p><p>MASTER, - A plea from a place so distant should have some weight, 
and from a heart so grateful should have some address.  I have been 
long in your debt, Master, and I did not think it could be so much 
increased as you have now increased it.  I was long in your debt 
and deep in your debt for many poems that I shall never forget, and 
for SIGURD before all, and now you have plunged me beyond payment 
by the Saga Library.  And so now, true to human nature, being 
plunged beyond payment, I come and bark at your heels.
</p><p>For surely, Master, that tongue that we write, and that you have 
illustrated so nobly, is yet alive.  She has her rights and laws, 
and is our mother, our queen, and our instrument.  Now in that 
living tongue WHERE has one sense, WHEREAS another.  In the 
HEATHSLAYINGS STORY, p. 241, line 13, it bears one of its ordinary 
senses.  Elsewhere and usually through the two volumes, which is 
all that has yet reached me of this entrancing publication, WHEREAS 
is made to figure for WHERE.
</p><p>For the love of God, my dear and honoured Morris, use WHERE, and 
let us know WHEREAS we are, wherefore our gratitude shall grow, 
whereby you shall be the more honoured wherever men love clear 
language, whereas now, although we honour, we are troubled.
</p><p>Whereunder, please find inscribed to this very impudent but yet 
very anxious document, the name of one of the most distant but not 
the youngest or the coldest of those who honour you.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. CHARLES FAIRCHILD</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, MARCH 1892.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD, - I am guilty in your sight, but my affairs 
besiege me.      The chief-justiceship of a family of nineteen 
persons is in itself no sinecure, and sometimes occupies me for 
days:  two weeks ago for four days almost entirely, and for two 
days entirely.  Besides which, I have in the last few months 
written all but one chapter of a HISTORY OF SAMOA for the last 
eight or nine years; and while I was unavoidably delayed in the 
writing of this, awaiting material, put in one-half of DAVID 
BALFOUR, the sequel to KIDNAPPED.  Add the ordinary impediments of 
life, and admire my busyness.  I am now an old, but healthy 
skeleton, and degenerate much towards the machine.  By six at work:  
stopped at half-past ten to give a history lesson to a step-
grandson; eleven, lunch; after lunch we have a musical performance 
till two; then to work again; bath, 4.40, dinner, five; cards in 
the evening till eight; and then to bed - only I have no bed, only 
a chest with a mat and blankets - and read myself to sleep.  This 
is the routine, but often sadly interrupted.  Then you may see me 
sitting on the floor of my verandah haranguing and being harangued 
by squatting chiefs on a question of a road; or more privately 
holding an inquiry into some dispute among our familiars, myself on 
my bed, the boys on the floor - for when it comes to the judicial I 
play dignity - or else going down to Apia on some more or less 
unsatisfactory errand.  Altogether it is a life that suits me, but 
it absorbs me like an ocean.  That is what I have always envied and 
admired in Scott; with all that immensity of work and study, his 
mind kept flexible, glancing to all points of natural interest.  
But the lean hot spirits, such as mine, become hypnotised with 
their bit occupations - if I may use Scotch to you - it is so far 
more scornful than any English idiom.  Well, I can't help being a 
skeleton, and you are to take this devious passage for an apology.
</p><p>I thought ALADDIN capital fun; but why, in fortune, did he pretend 
it was moral at the end?  The so-called nineteenth century, OU VA-
T-IL SE NICHER?  'Tis a trifle, but Pyle would do well to knock the 
passage out, and leave his boguey tale a boguey tale, and a good 
one at that.
</p><p>The arrival of your box was altogether a great success to the 
castaways.  You have no idea where we live.  Do you know, in all 
these islands there are not five hundred whites, and no postal 
delivery, and only one village - it is no more - and would be a 
mean enough village in Europe?  We were asked the other day if 
Vailima were the name of our post town, and we laughed.  Do you 
know, though we are but three miles from the village metropolis, we 
have no road to it, and our goods are brought on the pack-saddle?  
And do you know - or I should rather say, can you believe - or (in 
the famous old Tichborne trial phrase) would you be surprised to 
learn, that all you have read of Vailima - or Subpriorsford, as I 
call it - is entirely false, and we have no ice-machine, and no 
electric light, and no water supply but the cistern of the heavens, 
and but one public room, and scarce a bedroom apiece?  But, of 
course, it is well known that I have made enormous sums by my 
evanescent literature, and you will smile at my false humility.  
The point, however, is much on our minds just now.  We are 
expecting an invasion of Kiplings; very glad we shall be to see 
them; but two of the party are ladies, and I tell you we had to 
hold a council of war to stow them.  You European ladies are so 
particular; with all of mine, sleeping has long become a public 
function, as with natives and those who go down much into the sea 
in ships.
</p><p>Dear Mrs. Fairchild, I must go to my work.  I have but two words to 
say in conclusion.
</p><p>First, civilisation is rot.
</p><p>Second, console a savage with more of the milk of that over 
civilised being, your adorable schoolboy.
</p><p>As I wrote these remarkable words, I was called down to eight 
o'clock prayers, and have just worked through a chapter of Joshua 
and five verses, with five treble choruses of a Samoan hymn; but 
the music was good, our boys and precentress ('tis always a woman 
that leads) did better than I ever heard them, and to my great 
pleasure I understood it all except one verse.  This gave me the 
more time to try and identify what the parts were doing, and 
further convict my dull ear.  Beyond the fact that the soprano rose 
to the tonic above, on one occasion I could recognise nothing.  
This is sickening, but I mean to teach my ear better before I am 
done with it or this vile carcase.
</p><p>I think it will amuse you (for a last word) to hear that our 
precentress - she is the washerwoman - is our shame.  She is a 
good, healthy, comely, strapping young wench, full of energy and 
seriousness, a splendid workwoman, delighting to train our chorus, 
delighting in the poetry of the hymns, which she reads aloud (on 
the least provocation) with a great sentiment of rhythm.  Well, 
then, what is curious?  Ah, we did not know! but it was told us in 
a whisper from the cook-house - she is not of good family.  Don't 
let it get out, please; everybody knows it, of course, here; there 
is no reason why Europe and the States should have the advantage of 
me also.  And the rest of my housefolk are all chief-people, I 
assure you.  And my late overseer (far the best of his race) is a 
really serious chief with a good 'name.'  Tina is the name; it is 
not in the Almanach de Gotha, it must have got dropped at press.  
The odd thing is, we rather share the prejudice.  I have almost 
always - though not quite always - found the higher the chief the 
better the man through all the islands; or, at least, that the best 
man came always from a highish rank.  I hope Helen will continue to 
prove a bright exception.
</p><p>With love to Fairchild and the Huge Schoolboy, I am, my dear Mrs. 
Fairchild, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>[VAILIMA, MARCH 1892.]
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - Herewith Chapters IX. and X., and I am left 
face to face with the horrors and dilemmas of the present regimen:  
pray for those that go down to the sea in ships.  I have promised 
Henley shall have a chance to publish the hurricane chapter if he 
like, so please let the slips be sent QUAM PRIMUM to C. Baxter, 
W.S., 11 S. Charlotte Street, Edinburgh.  I got on mighty quick 
with that chapter - about five days of the toughest kind of work.  
God forbid I should ever have such another pirn to wind!  When I 
invent a language, there shall be a direct and an indirect pronoun 
differently declined - then writing would be some fun.
</p><p><br />

<dd>His        Tus</dd></dl>
<p><br />
Ex.:  HE seized TUM by TUS throat; but TU at the same moment caught 
HIM by HIS hair.  A fellow could write hurricanes with an 
inflection like that!  Yet there would he difficulties too.
</p><p>Do what you please about THE BEACH; and I give you CARTE BLANCHE to 
write in the matter to Baxter - or telegraph if the time press - to 
delay the English contingent.  Herewith the two last slips of THE 
WRECKER.  I cannot go beyond.  By the way, pray compliment the 
printers on the proofs of the Samoa racket, but hint to them that 
it is most unbusiness-like and unscholarly to clip the edges of the 
galleys; these proofs should really have been sent me on large 
paper; and I and my friends here are all put to a great deal of 
trouble and confusion by the mistake. - For, as you must conceive, 
in a matter so contested and complicated, the number of corrections 
and the length of explanations is considerable.

<p><b>Letter:  TO T. W. DOVER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, UPOLU, SAMOA, JUNE 20TH, 1892.
</p><p>SIR, - In reply to your very interesting letter, I cannot fairly 
say that I have ever been poor, or known what it was to want a 
meal.  I have been reduced, however, to a very small sum of money, 
with no apparent prospect of increasing it; and at that time I 
reduced myself to practically one meal a day, with the most 
disgusting consequences to my health.  At this time I lodged in the 
house of a working man, and associated much with others.  At the 
same time, from my youth up, I have always been a good deal and 
rather intimately thrown among the working-classes, partly as a 
civil engineer in out-of-the-way places, partly from a strong and, 
I hope, not ill-favoured sentiment of curiosity.  But the place 
where, perhaps, I was most struck with the fact upon which you 
comment was the house of a friend, who was exceedingly poor, in 
fact, I may say destitute, and who lived in the attic of a very 
tall house entirely inhabited by persons in varying stages of 
poverty.  As he was also in ill-health, I made a habit of passing 
my afternoon with him, and when there it was my part to answer the 
door.  The steady procession of people begging, and the expectant 
and confident manner in which they presented themselves, struck me 
more and more daily; and I could not but remember with surprise 
that though my father lived but a few streets away in a fine house, 
beggars scarce came to the door once a fortnight or a month.  From 
that time forward I made it my business to inquire, and in the 
stories which I am very fond of hearing from all sorts and 
conditions of men, learned that in the time of their distress it 
was always from the poor they sought assistance, and almost always 
from the poor they got it.
</p><p>Trusting I have now satisfactorily answered your question, which I 
thank you for asking, I remain, with sincere compliments,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA, SUMMER 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - First of all, YOU HAVE ALL THE CORRECTIONS ON 
'THE WRECKER.'  I found I had made what I meant and forgotten it, 
and was so careless as not to tell you.
</p><p>Second, of course, and by all means, charge corrections on the 
Samoa book to me; but there are not near so many as I feared.  The 
Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, and I believe all my advisers 
were amazed to see how nearly correct I had got the truck, at least 
I was.  With this you will receive the whole revise and a 
typewritten copy of the last chapter.  And the thing now is Speed, 
to catch a possible revision of the treaty.  I believe Cassells are 
to bring it out, but Baxter knows, and the thing has to be crammed 
through PRESTISSIMO, A LA CHASSEUR.
</p><p>You mention the belated Barbeys; what about the equally belated 
Pineros?  And I hope you will keep your bookshop alive to supplying 
me continuously with the SAGA LIBRARY.  I cannot get enough of 
SAGAS; I wish there were nine thousand; talk about realism!
</p><p>All seems to flourish with you; I also prosper; none the less for 
being quit of that abhorred task, Samoa.  I could give a supper 
party here were there any one to sup.  Never was such a 
disagreeable task, but the thing had to be told. . . .
</p><p>There, I trust I am done with this cursed chapter of my career, bar 
the rotten eggs and broken bottles that may follow, of course.  
Pray remember, speed is now all that can be asked, hoped, or 
wished.  I give up all hope of proofs, revises, proof of the map, 
or sic like; and you on your side will try to get it out as 
reasonably seemly as may be.
</p><p>Whole Samoa book herewith.  Glory be to God. - Yours very 
sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, UPOLU, SAMOAN ISLANDS, 18TH JULY 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES,- . . . I have been now for some time contending 
with powers and principalities, and I have never once seen one of 
my own letters to the TIMES.  So when you see something in the 
papers that you think might interest the exiles of Upolu, do not 
think twice, out with your saxpence, and send it flying to Vailima.  
Of what you say of the past, eh, man, it was a queer time, and 
awful miserable, but there's no sense in denying it was awful fun.  
Do you mind the youth in Highland garb and the tableful of coppers?  
Do you mind the SIGNAL of Waterloo Place? - Hey, how the blood 
stands to the heart at such a memory! - Hae ye the notes o't?  
Gie's them. - Gude's sake, man, gie's the notes o't; I mind ye made 
a tune o't an' played it on your pinanny; gie's the notes.  Dear 
Lord, that past.
</p><p>Glad to hear Henley's prospects are fair:  his new volume is the 
work of a real poet.  He is one of those who can make a noise of 
his own with words, and in whom experience strikes an individual 
note.  There is perhaps no more genuine poet living, bar the Big 
Guns.  In case I cannot overtake an acknowledgment to himself by 
this mail, please let him hear of my pleasure and admiration.  How 
poorly - compares!  He is all smart journalism and cleverness:  it 
is all bright and shallow and limpid, like a business paper - a 
good one, S'ENTEND; but there is no blot of heart's blood and the 
Old Night:  there are no harmonics, there is scarce harmony to his 
music; and in Henley - all of these; a touch, a sense within sense, 
a sound outside the sound, the shadow of the inscrutable, eloquent 
beyond all definition.  The First London Voluntary knocked me 
wholly. - Ever yours affectionately, my dear Charles,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>Kind memories to your father and all friends.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, UPOLU, SAMOA, AUGUST 1ST, 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR HENLEY, - It is impossible to let your new volume pass in 
silence.  I have not received the same thrill of poetry since G. 
M.'s JOY OF EARTH volume and LOVE IN A VALLEY; and I do not know 
that even that was so intimate and deep.  Again and again, I take 
the book down, and read, and my blood is fired as it used to be in 
youth.  ANDANTE CON MOTO in the VOLUNTARIES, and the thing about 
the trees at night (No. XXIV. I think) are up to date my 
favourites.  I did not guess you were so great a magician; these 
are new tunes, this is an undertone of the true Apollo; these are 
not verse, they are poetry - inventions, creations, in language.  I 
thank you for the joy you have given me, and remain your old friend 
and present huge admirer,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>The hand is really the hand of Esau, but under a course of 
threatened scrivener's cramp.
</p><p>For the next edition of the Book of Verses, pray accept an 
emendation.  Last three lines of Echoes No. XLIV. read -
</p><p><br />
'But life in act?  How should the grave
Be victor over these,
Mother, a mother of men?'

The two vocatives scatter the effect of this inimitable close.  If 
you insist on the longer line, equip 'grave' with an epithet.

</p><p>VAILIMA, UPOLU, AUGUST 1st, '92.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - Herewith MY GRANDFATHER.  I have had rather a 
bad time suppressing the old gentleman, who was really in a very 
garrulous stage; as for getting him IN ORDER, I could do but little 
towards that; however, there are one or two points of interest 
which may justify us in printing.  The swinging of his stick and 
not knowing the sailor of Coruiskin, in particular, and the account 
of how he wrote the lives in the Bell Book particularly please me. 
I hope my own little introduction is not egoistic; or rather I do 
not care if it is.  It was that old gentleman's blood that brought 
me to Samoa.
</p><p>By the by, vols. vii., viii., and ix. of Adams's HISTORY have never 
come to hand; no more have the dictionaries.
</p><p>Please send me STONEHENGE ON HORSE, STORIES AND INTERLUDES by Barry 
Pain, and EDINBURGH SKETCHES AND MEMOIRS by David Masson.  THE 
WRECKER has turned up.  So far as I have seen, it is very 
satisfactory, but on pp. 548, 549, there has been a devil of a 
miscarriage.  The two Latin quotations instead of following each 
other being separated (doubtless for printing considerations) by a 
line of prose.  My compliments to the printers; there is doubtless 
such a thing as good printing, but there is such a thing as good 
sense.
</p><p>The sequel to KIDNAPPED, DAVID BALFOUR by name, is about three-
quarters done and gone to press for serial publication.  By what I 
can find out it ought to be through hand with that and ready for 
volume form early next spring. - Yours very sincerely,

<p><b>Letter:  TO ANDREW LANG</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, AUGUST 1892.]
</p><p>MY DEAR LANG, - I knew you would prove a trusty purveyor.  The 
books you have sent are admirable.  I got the name of my hero out 
of Brown - Blair of Balmyle - Francie Blair.  But whether to call 
the story BLAIR OF BALMYLE, or whether to call it THE YOUNG 
CHEVALIER, I have not yet decided.  The admirable Cameronian tract 
- perhaps you will think this a cheat - is to be boned into DAVID 
BALFOUR, where it will fit better, and really furnishes me with a 
desired foothold over a boggy place.
</p><p>LATER; no, it won't go in, and I fear I must give up 'the 
idolatrous occupant upon the throne,' a phrase that overjoyed me 
beyond expression.  I am in a deuce of a flutter with politics, 
which I hate, and in which I certainly do not shine; but a fellow 
cannot stand aside and look on at such an exhibition as our 
government.  'Taint decent; no gent can hold a candle to it.  But 
it's a grind to be interrupted by midnight messengers and pass your 
days writing proclamations (which are never proclaimed) and 
petitions (which ain't petited) and letters to the TIMES, which it 
makes my jaws yawn to re-read, and all your time have your heart 
with David Balfour:  he has just left Glasgow this morning for 
Edinburgh, James More has escaped from the castle; it is far more 
real to me than the Behring Sea or the Baring brothers either - he 
got the news of James More's escape from the Lord Advocate, and 
started off straight to comfort Catriona.  You don't know her; 
she's James More's daughter, and a respectable young wumman; the 
Miss Grants think so - the Lord Advocate's daughters - so there 
can't be anything really wrong.  Pretty soon we all go to Holland, 
and be hanged; thence to Dunkirk, and be damned; and the tale 
concludes in Paris, and be Poll-parrotted.  This is the last 
authentic news.  You are not a real hard-working novelist; not a 
practical novelist; so you don't know the temptation to let your 
characters maunder.  Dumas did it, and lived.  But it is not war; 
it ain't sportsmanlike, and I have to be stopping their chatter all 
the time.  Brown's appendix is great reading.

My only grief is that I can't
Use the idolatrous occupant.

the style of the '45.  What a misfortune, my dear cousin, that you

might be agreeable to your political opinions.  All present will be

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. CHARLES FAIRCHILD</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[VAILIMA, AUGUST 1892.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD, - Thank you a thousand times for your 
letter.  You are the Angel of (the sort of) Information (that I 
care about); I appoint you successor to the newspaper press; and I 
beg of you, whenever you wish to gird at the age, or think the bugs 
out of proportion to the roses, or despair, or enjoy any cosmic or 
epochal emotion, to sit down again and write to the Hermit of 
Samoa.  What do I think of it all?  Well, I love the romantic 
solemnity of youth; and even in this form, although not without 
laughter, I have to love it still.  They are such ducks!  But what 
are they made of?  We were just as solemn as that about atheism and 
the stars and humanity; but we were all for belief anyway - we held 
atheism and sociology (of which none of us, nor indeed anybody, 
knew anything) for a gospel and an iron rule of life; and it was 
lucky enough, or there would have been more windows broken.  What 
is apt to puzzle one at first sight in the New Youth is that, with 
such rickety and risky problems always at heart, they should not 
plunge down a Niagara of Dissolution.  But let us remember the high 
practical timidity of youth.  I was a particularly brave boy - this 
I think of myself, looking back - and plunged into adventures and 
experiments, and ran risks that it still surprises me to recall.  
But, dear me, what a fear I was in of that strange blind machinery 
in the midst of which I stood; and with what a compressed heart and 
what empty lungs I would touch a new crank and await developments!  
I do not mean to say I do not fear life still; I do; and that 
terror (for an adventurer like myself) is still one of the chief 
joys of living.
</p><p>But it was different indeed while I was yet girt with the priceless 
robes of inexperience; then the fear was exquisite and infinite.  
And so, when you see all these little Ibsens, who seem at once so 
dry and so excitable, and faint in swathes over a play (I suppose - 
for a wager) that would seem to me merely tedious, smile behind 
your hand, and remember the little dears are all in a blue funk.  
It must be very funny, and to a spectator like yourself I almost 
envy it.  But never get desperate; human nature is human nature; 
and the Roman Empire, since the Romans founded it and made our 
European human nature what it is, bids fair to go on and to be true 
to itself.  These little bodies will all grow up and become men and 
women, and have heaps of fun; nay, and are having it now; and 
whatever happens to the fashion of the age, it makes no difference 
- there are always high and brave and amusing lives to be lived; 
and a change of key, however exotic, does not exclude melody.  Even 
Chinamen, hard as we find it to believe, enjoy being Chinese.  And 
the Chinaman stands alone to be unthinkable; natural enough, as the 
representative of the only other great civilisation.  Take my 
people here at my doors; their life is a very good one; it is quite 
thinkable, quite acceptable to us.  And the little dears will be 
soon skating on the other foot; sooner or later, in each 
generation, the one-half of them at least begin to remember all the 
material they had rejected when first they made and nailed up their 
little theory of life; and these become reactionaries or 
conservatives, and the ship of man begins to fill upon the other 
tack.
</p><p>Here is a sermon, by your leave!  It is your own fault, you have 
amused and interested me so much by your breath of the New Youth, 
which comes to me from so far away, where I live up here in my 
mountain, and secret messengers bring me letters from rebels, and 
the government sometimes seizes them, and generally grumbles in its 
beard that Stevenson should really be deported.  O, my life is the 
more lively, never fear!
</p><p>It has recently been most amusingly varied by a visit from Lady 
Jersey.  I took her over mysteriously (under the pseudonym of my 
cousin, Miss Amelia Balfour) to visit Mataafa, our rebel; and we 
had great fun, and wrote a <a href="/wiki/Author:Marie_Louise_de_la_Ram%C3%A9e" title="Author:Marie Louise de la Ramée">Ouida</a> novel on our life here, in which 
every author had to describe himself in the Ouida glamour, and of 
which - for the Jerseys intend printing it - I must let you have a 
copy.  My wife's chapter, and my description of myself, should, I 
think, amuse you.  But there were finer touches still; as when 
Belle and Lady Jersey came out to brush their teeth in front of the 
rebel King's palace, and the night guard squatted opposite on the 
grass and watched the process; or when I and my interpreter, and 
the King with his secretary, mysteriously disappeared to conspire. 
- Ever yours sincerely,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

TO THE ARTIST WHO DID THE ILLUSTRATIONS TO 'UMA.'
</p><p>DEAR SIR, - I only know you under the initials G. B., but you have 
done some exceedingly spirited and satisfactory illustrations to my 
story THE BEACH OF FALESA, and I wish to write and thank you 
expressly for the care and talent shown.  Such numbers of people 
can do good black and whites!  So few can illustrate a story, or 
apparently read it.  You have shown that you can do both, and your 
creation of Wiltshire is a real illumination of the text.  It was 
exactly so that Wiltshire dressed and looked, and you have the line 
of his nose to a nicety.  His nose is an inspiration.  Nor should I 
forget to thank you for Case, particularly in his last appearance.  
It is a singular fact - which seems to point still more directly to 
inspiration in your case - that your missionary actually resembles 
the flesh-and-blood person from whom Mr. Tarleton was drawn.  The 
general effect of the islands is all that could be wished; indeed I 
have but one criticism to make, that in the background of Case 
taking the dollar from Mr. Tarleton's head - head - not hand, as 
the fools have printed it - the natives have a little too much the 
look of Africans.
</p><p>But the great affair is that you have been to the pains to 
illustrate my story instead of making conscientious black and 
whites of people sitting talking.  I doubt if you have left 
unrepresented a single pictorial incident.  I am writing by this 
mail to the editor in the hopes that I may buy from him the 
originals, and I am, dear sir, your very much obliged,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>VAILIMA, SAMOAN ISLANDS, OCTOBER 7TH, 1892.
</p><p>DEAR MADAM, - I have a great diffidence in answering your valued 
letter.  It would be difficult for me to express the feelings with 
which I read it - and am now trying to re-read it as I dictate 
this.
</p><p>You ask me to forgive what you say 'must seem a liberty,' and I 
find that I cannot thank you sufficiently or even find a word with 
which to qualify your letter.  Dear Madam, such a communication 
even the vainest man would think a sufficient reward for a lifetime 
of labour.  That I should have been able to give so much help and 
pleasure to your sister is the subject of my grateful wonder.
</p><p>That she, being dead, and speaking with your pen, should be able to 
repay the debt with such a liberal interest, is one of those things 
that reconcile us with the world and make us take hope again.  I do 
not know what I have done to deserve so beautiful and touching a 
compliment; and I feel there is but one thing fit for me to say 
here, that I will try with renewed courage to go on in the same 
path, and to deserve, if not to receive, a similar return from 
others.
</p><p>You apologise for speaking so much about yourselves.  Dear Madam, I 
thought you did so too little.  I should have wished to have known 
more of those who were so sympathetic as to find a consolation in 
my work, and so graceful and so tactful as to acknowledge it in 
such a letter as was yours.
</p><p>Will you offer to your mother the expression of a sympathy which 
(coming from a stranger) must seem very airy, but which yet is 
genuine; and accept for yourself my gratitude for the thought which 
inspired you to write to me and the words which you found to 
express it.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, SAMOAN ISLANDS, OCT. 10TH, 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - It is now, as you see, the 10th of October, 
and there has not reached the Island of Upolu one single copy, or 
rag of a copy, of the Samoa book.  I lie; there has come one, and 
that in the pocket of a missionary man who is at daggers drawn with 
me, who lends it to all my enemies, conceals it from all my 
friends, and is bringing a lawsuit against me on the strength of 
expressions in the same which I have forgotten, and now cannot see.  
This is pretty tragic, I think you will allow; and I was inclined 
to fancy it was the fault of the Post Office.  But I hear from my 
sister-in-law Mrs. Sanchez that she is in the same case, and has 
received no 'Footnote.'  I have also to consider that I had no 
letter from you last mail, although you ought to have received by 
that time 'My Grandfather and Scott,' and 'Me and my Grandfather.'  
Taking one consideration with another, therefore, I prefer to 
conceive that No. 743 Broadway has fallen upon gentle and 
continuous slumber, and is become an enchanted palace among 
publishing houses.  If it be not so, if the 'Footnotes' were really 
sent, I hope you will fall upon the Post Office with all the vigour 
you possess.  How does THE WRECKER go in the States?  It seems to 
be doing exceptionally well in England. - Yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO J. M.  BARRIE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, SAMOAN ISLANDS, NOVEMBER 1ST, 1892.
</p><p>DEAR MR. BARRIE, - I can scarce thank you sufficiently for your 
extremely amusing letter.  No, THE AULD LICHT IDYLS never reached 
me - I wish it had, and I wonder extremely whether it would not be 
good for me to have a pennyworth of the Auld Licht pulpit.  It is a 
singular thing that I should live here in the South Seas under 
conditions so new and so striking, and yet my imagination so 
continually inhabit that cold old huddle of grey hills from which 
we come.  I have just finished DAVID BALFOUR; I have another book 
on the stocks, THE YOUNG CHEVALIER, which is to be part in France 
and part in Scotland, and to deal with Prince Charlie about the 
year 1749; and now what have I done but begun a third which is to 
be all moorland together, and is to have for a centrepiece a figure 
that I think you will appreciate - that of the immortal Braxfield - 
Braxfield himself is my GRAND PREMIER, or, since you are so much 
involved in the British drama, let me say my heavy lead. . . .
</p><p>Your descriptions of your dealings with Lord Rintoul are 
frightfully unconscientious.  You should never write about anybody 
until you persuade yourself at least for the moment that you love 
him, above all anybody on whom your plot revolves.  It will always 
make a hole in the book; and, if he has anything to do with the 
mechanism, prove a stick in your machinery.  But you know all this 
better than I do, and it is one of your most promising traits that 
you do not take your powers too seriously.  The LITTLE MINISTER 
ought to have ended badly; we all know it did; and we are 
infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with 
which you lied about it.  If you had told the truth, I for one 
could never have forgiven you.  As you had conceived and written 
the earlier parts, the truth about the end, though indisputably 
true to fact, would have been a lie, or what is worse, a discord in 
art.  If you are going to make a book end badly, it must end badly 
from the beginning.  Now your book began to end well.  You let 
yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets.  
Once you had done that, your honour was committed - at the cost of 
truth to life you were bound to save them.  It is the blot on 
RICHARD FEVEREL, for instance, that it begins to end well; and then 
tricks you and ends ill.  But in that case there is worse behind, 
for the ill-ending does not inherently issue from the plot - the 
story HAD, in fact, ENDED WELL after the great last interview 
between Richard and Lucy - and the blind, illogical bullet which 
smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to 
do with the room into whose open window it comes buzzing.  It MIGHT 
have so happened; it needed not; and unless needs must, we have no 
right to pain our readers.  I have had a heavy case of conscience 
of the same kind about my Braxfield story.  Braxfield - only his 
name is Hermiston - has a son who is condemned to death; plainly, 
there is a fine tempting fitness about this; and I meant he was to 
hang.  But now on considering my minor characters, I saw there were 
five people who would - in a sense who must - break prison and 
attempt his rescue.  They were capable, hardy folks, too, who might 
very well succeed.  Why should they not then?  Why should not young 
Hermiston escape clear out of the country? and be happy, if he 
could, with his -  But soft!  I will not betray my secret of my 
heroine.  Suffice it to breathe in your ear that she was what Hardy 
calls (and others in their plain way don't) a Pure Woman.  Much 
virtue in a capital letter, such as yours was.
</p><p>Write to me again in my infinite distance.  Tell me about your new 
book.  No harm in telling ME; I am too far off to be indiscreet; 
there are too few near me who would care to hear.  I am rushes by 
the riverside, and the stream is in Babylon:  breathe your secrets 
to me fearlessly; and if the Trade Wind caught and carried them 
away, there are none to catch them nearer than Australia, unless it 
were the Tropic Birds.  In the unavoidable absence of my 
amanuensis, who is buying eels for dinner, I have thus concluded my 
despatch, like St. Paul, with my own hand.
</p><p>And in the inimitable words of Lord Kames, Faur ye weel, ye bitch. 
- Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, NOV. 2ND, 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - In the first place, I have to acknowledge 
receipt of your munificent cheque for three hundred and fifty 
dollars.  Glad you liked the Scott voyage; rather more than I did 
upon the whole.  As the proofs have not turned up at all, there can 
be no question of returning them, and I am therefore very much 
pleased to think you have arranged not to wait.  The volumes of 
Adams arrived along with yours of October 6th.  One of the 
dictionaries has also blundered home, apparently from the Colonies; 
the other is still to seek.  I note and sympathise with your 
bewilderment as to FALESA.  My own direct correspondence with Mr. 
Baxter is now about three months in abeyance.  Altogether you see 
how well it would be if you could do anything to wake up the Post 
Office.  Not a single copy of the 'Footnote' has yet reached Samoa, 
but I hear of one having come to its address in Hawaii.  Glad to 
hear good news of Stoddard. - Yours sincerely,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - Since the above was written an aftermath of post matter came 
in, among which were the proofs of MY GRANDFATHER.  I shall correct 
and return them, but as I have lost all confidence in the Post 
Office, I shall mention here:  first galley, 4th line from the 
bottom, for 'AS' read 'OR.'
</p><p>Should I ever again have to use my work without waiting for proofs, 
bear in mind this golden principle.  From a congenital defect, I 
must suppose, I am unable to write the word OR - wherever I write 
it the printer unerringly puts AS - and those who read for me had 
better, wherever it is possible, substitute OR for AS.  This the 
more so since many writers have a habit of using AS which is death 
to my temper and confusion to my face.

<p><b>Letter:  TO LIEUTENANT EELES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>VAILIMA PLANTATION, UPOLU, SAMOAN ISLANDS, NOVEMBER 15TH, 1892.
</p><p>DEAR EELES, - In the first place, excuse me writing to you by 
another hand, as that is the way in which alone all my 
correspondence gets effected.  Before I took to this method, or 
rather before I found a victim, it SIMPLY didn't get effected.
</p><p>Thank you again and again, first for your kind thought of writing 
to me, and second for your extremely amusing and interesting 
letter.  You can have no guess how immediately interesting it was 
to our family.  First of all, the poor soul at Nukufetau is an old 
friend of ours, and we have actually treated him ourselves on a 
former visit to the island.  I don't know if Hoskin would approve 
of our treatment; it consisted, I believe, mostly in a present of 
stout and a recommendation to put nails in his water-tank.  We also 
(as you seem to have done) recommended him to leave the island; and 
I remember very well how wise and kind we thought his answer.  He 
had half-caste children (he said) who would suffer and perhaps be 
despised if he carried them elsewhere; if he left them there alone, 
they would almost certainly miscarry; and the best thing was that 
he should stay and die with them.  But the cream of the fun was 
your meeting with Burn.  We not only know him, but (as the French 
say) we don't know anybody else; he is our intimate and adored 
original; and - prepare your mind - he was, is, and ever will be, 
TOMMY HADDON!  As I don't believe you to be inspired, I suspect you 
to have suspected this.  At least it was a mighty happy suspicion.  
You are quite right:  Tommy is really 'a good chap,' though about 
as comic as they make them.
</p><p>I was extremely interested in your Fiji legend, and perhaps even 
more so in your capital account of the CURACOA'S misadventure.  
Alas! we have nothing so thrilling to relate.  All hangs and fools 
on in this isle of misgovernment, without change, though not 
without novelty, but wholly without hope, unless perhaps you should 
consider it hopeful that I am still more immediately threatened 
with arrest.  The confounded thing is, that if it comes off, I 
shall be sent away in the Ringarooma instead of the CURACOA.  The 
former ship burst upon by the run - she had been sent off by 
despatch and without orders - and to make me a little more easy in 
my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration.  
Since then I have had a conversation with the German Consul.  He 
said he had read a review of my Samoa book, and if the review were 
fair, must regard it as an insult, and one that would have to be 
resented.  At the same time, I learn that letters addressed to the 
German squadron lie for them here in the Post Office.  Reports are 
current of other English ships being on the way - I hope to 
goodness yours will be among the number.  And I gather from one 
thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between 
the powers at home, and that the issue (like all else connected 
with Samoa) is on the knees of the gods.  One thing, however, is 
pretty sure - if that issue prove to be a German Protectorate, I 
shall have to tramp.  Can you give us any advice as to a fresh 
field of energy?  We have been searching the atlas, and it seems 
difficult to fill the bill.  How would Rarotonga do?  I forget if 
you have been there.  The best of it is that my new house is going 
up like winking, and I am dictating this letter to the 
accompaniment of saws and hammers.  A hundred black boys and about 
a score draught-oxen perished, or at least barely escaped with 
their lives, from the mud-holes on our road, bringing up the 
materials.  It will be a fine legacy to H.I.G.M.'s Protectorate, 
and doubtless the Governor will take it for his country-house.  The 
Ringarooma people, by the way, seem very nice.  I liked Stansfield 
particularly.
</p><p>Our middy has gone up to San Francisco in pursuit of the phantom 
Education.  We have good word of him, and I hope he will not be in 
disgrace again, as he was when the hope of the British Navy - need 
I say that I refer to Admiral Burney? - honoured us last.  The next 
time you come, as the new house will be finished, we shall be able 
to offer you a bed.  Nares and Meiklejohn may like to hear that our 
new room is to be big enough to dance in.  It will be a very 
pleasant day for me to see the Curacoa in port again and at least a 
proper contingent of her officers 'skipping in my 'all.'
</p><p>We have just had a feast on my birthday at which we had three of 
the Ringaromas, and I wish they had been three CURACOAS - say 
yourself, Hoskin, and Burney the ever Great.  (Consider this an 
invitation.)  Our boys had got the thing up regardless.  There were 
two huge sows - oh, brutes of animals that would have broken down a 
hansom cab - four smaller pigs, two barrels of beef, and a horror 
of vegetables and fowls.  We sat down between forty and fifty in a 
big new native house behind the kitchen that you have never seen, 
and ate and public spoke till all was blue.  Then we had about half 
an hour's holiday with some beer and sherry and brandy and soda to 
restrengthen the European heart, and then out to the old native 
house to see a siva.  Finally, all the guests were packed off in a 
trackless black night and down a road that was rather fitted for 
the CURACOA than any human pedestrian, though to be sure I do not 
know the draught of the CURACOA.  My ladies one and all desire to 
be particularly remembered to our friends on board, and all look 
forward, as I do myself, in the hope of your return. - Yours 
sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>DECEMBER 5TH, 1892.
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES, - How comes it so great a silence has fallen?  The 
still small voice of self-approval whispers me it is not from me.  
I have looked up my register, and find I have neither written to 
you nor heard from you since June 22nd, on which day of grace that 
invaluable work began.  This is not as it should be.  How to get 
back?  I remember acknowledging with rapture the - of the MASTER, 
and I remember receiving MARBOT:  was that our last relation?
</p><p>Hey, well! anyway, as you may have probably gathered from the 
papers, I have been in devilish hot water, and (what may be new to 
you) devilish hard at work.  In twelve calendar months I finished 
THE WRECKER, wrote all of FALESA but the first chapter (well, much 
of), the HISTORY OF SAMOA, did something here and there to my LIFE 
OF MY GRANDFATHER, and began And Finished DAVID BALFOUR.  What do 
you think of it for a year?  Since then I may say I have done 
nothing beyond draft three chapters of another novel, THE JUSTICE-
CLERK, which ought to be shorter and a blower - at least if it 
don't make a spoon, it will spoil the horn of an Aurochs (if that's 
how it should be spelt).
</p><p>On the hot water side it may entertain you to know that I have been 
actually sentenced to deportation by my friends on Mulinuu, C. J. 
Cedercrantz, and Baron Senfft von Pilsach.  The awful doom, 
however, declined to fall, owing to Circumstances over Which.  I 
only heard of it (so to speak) last night.  I mean officially, but 
I had walked among rumours.  The whole tale will be some day put 
into my hand, and I shall share it with humorous friends.
</p><p>It is likely, however, by my judgment, that this epoch of gaiety in 
Samoa will soon cease; and the fierce white light of history will 
beat no longer on Yours Sincerely and his fellows here on the 
beach.  We ask ourselves whether the reason will more rejoice over 
the end of a disgraceful business, or the unregenerate man more 
sorrow over the stoppage of the fun.  For, say what you please, it 
has been a deeply interesting time.  You don't know what news is, 
nor what politics, nor what the life of man, till you see it on so 
small a scale and with your own liberty on the board for stake.  I 
would not have missed it for much.  And anxious friends beg me to 
stay at home and study human nature in Brompton drawing-rooms!  
FARCEURS!  And anyway you know that such is not my talent.  I could 
never be induced to take the faintest interest in Brompton QUA 
Brompton or a drawing-room QUA a drawing-room.  I am an Epick 
Writer with a k to it, but without the necessary genius.
</p><p>Hurry up with another book of stories.  I am now reduced to two of 
my contemporaries, you and Barrie - O, and Kipling - you and Barrie 
and Kipling are now my Muses Three.  And with Kipling, as you know, 
there are reservations to be made.  And you and Barrie don't write 
enough.  I should say I also read Anstey when he is serious, and 
can almost always get a happy day out of Marion Crawford - CE N'EST 
PAS TOUJOURS LA GUERRE, but it's got life to it and guts, and it 
moves.  Did you read the WITCH OF PRAGUE?  Nobody could read it 
twice, of course; and the first time even it was necessary to skip.  
E PUR SI MUOVE.  But Barrie is a beauty, the LITTLE MINISTER and 
the WINDOW IN THRUMS, eh?  Stuff in that young man; but he must see 
and not be too funny.  Genius in him, but there's a journalist at 
his elbow - there's the risk.  Look, what a page is the glove 
business in the WINDOW! knocks a man flat; that's guts, if you 
please.
</p><p>Why have I wasted the little time that is left with a sort of naked 
review article?  I don't know, I'm sure.  I suppose a mere 
ebullition of congested literary talk I am beginning to think a 
visit from friends would be due.  Wish you could come!
</p><p>Let us have your news anyway, and forgive this silly stale 
effusion. - Yours ever,

I have been off my work for some time, and re-read the EDINBURGH

your sauce back again, and see how you would like it yourself.  And 
then I read (for the first time - I know not how) the WINDOW IN 
THRUMS; I don't say that it is better than THE MINISTER; it's less 
of a tale - and there is a beauty, a material beauty, of the tale 
IPSE, which clever critics nowadays long and love to forget; it has 
more real flaws; but somehow it is - well, I read it last anyway, 
and it's by Barrie.  And he's the man for my money.  The glove is a 
great page; it is startlingly original, and as true as death and 
judgment.  Tibbie Birse in the Burial is great, but I think it was 
a journalist that got in the word 'official.'  The same character 
plainly had a word to say to Thomas Haggard.  Thomas affects me as 
a lie - I beg your pardon; doubtless he was somebody you knew, that 
leads people so far astray.  The actual is not the true.
</p><p>I am proud to think you are a Scotchman - though to be sure I know 
nothing of that country, being only an English tourist, quo' Gavin 
Ogilvy.  I commend the hard case of Mr. Gavin Ogilvy to J. M. 
Barrie, whose work is to me a source of living pleasure and 
heartfelt national pride.  There are two of us now that the Shirra 
might have patted on the head.  And please do not think when I thus 
seem to bracket myself with you, that I am wholly blinded with 
vanity.  Jess is beyond my frontier line; I could not touch her 
skirt; I have no such glamour of twilight on my pen.  I am a 
capable artist; but it begins to look to me as if you were a man of 
genius.  Take care of yourself, for my sake.  It's a devilish hard 
thing for a man who writes so many novels as I do, that I should 
get so few to read.  And I can read yours, and I love them.
</p><p>A pity for you that my amanuensis is not on stock to-day, and my 
own hand perceptibly worse than usual. - Yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>DECEMBER 5TH, 1892.
</p><p>P.S. - They tell me your health is not strong.  Man, come out here 
and try the Prophet's chamber.  There's only one bad point to us - 
we do rise early.  The Amanuensis states that you are a lover of 
silence - and that ours is a noisy house - and she is a chatterbox 
- I am not answerable for these statements, though I do think there 
is a touch of garrulity about my premises.  We have so little to 
talk about, you see.  The house is three miles from town, in the 
midst of great silent forests.  There is a burn close by, and when 
we are not talking you can hear the burn, and the birds, and the 
sea breaking on the coast three miles away and six hundred feet 
below us, and about three times a month a bell - I don't know where 
the bell is, nor who rings it; it may be the bell in Hans 
Andersen's story for all I know.  It is never hot here - 86 in the 
shade is about our hottest - and it is never cold except just in 
the early mornings.  Take it for all in all, I suppose this island 
climate to be by far the healthiest in the world - even the 
influenza entirely lost its sting.  Only two patients died, and one 
was a man nearly eighty, and the other a child below four months.  
I won't tell you if it is beautiful, for I want you to come here 
and see for yourself.  Everybody on the premises except my wife has 
some Scotch blood in their veins - I beg your pardon - except the 
natives - and then my wife is a Dutchwoman - and the natives are 
the next thing conceivable to Highlanders before the forty-five.  
We would have some grand cracks!
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>COME, it will broaden your mind, and be the making of me.
</p>
