</p><p>YACHT 'CASCO,' ANAHO BAY, NUKAHIVA, MARQUESAS ISLANDS [JULY 1888].
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - From this somewhat (ahem) out of the way place, I 
write to say how d'ye do.  It is all a swindle:  I chose these 
isles as having the most beastly population, and they are far 
better, and far more civilised than we.  I know one old chief Ko-o-
amua, a great cannibal in his day, who ate his enemies even as he 
walked home from killing 'em, and he is a perfect gentleman and 
exceedingly amiable and simple-minded:  no fool, though.
</p><p>The climate is delightful; and the harbour where we lie one of the 
loveliest spots imaginable.  Yesterday evening we had near a score 
natives on board; lovely parties.  We have a native god; very rare 
now.  Very rare and equally absurd to view.
</p><p>This sort of work is not favourable to correspondence:  it takes me 
all the little strength I have to go about and see, and then come 
home and note, the strangeness around us.  I shouldn't wonder if 
there came trouble here some day, all the same.  I could name a 
nation that is not beloved in certain islands - and it does not 
know it!  Strange:  like ourselves, perhaps, in India!  Love to all 
and much to yourself.

</p><p>YACHT 'CASCO,' AT SEA, NEAR THE PAUMOTUS, 7 A.M., SEPTEMBER 6TH, 
1888, WITH A DREADFUL PEN.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Last night as I lay under my blanket in the 
cockpit, courting sleep, I had a comic seizure.  There was nothing 
visible but the southern stars, and the steersman there out by the 
binnacle lamp; we were all looking forward to a most deplorable 
landfall on the morrow, praying God we should fetch a tuft of palms 
which are to indicate the Dangerous Archipelago; the night was as 
warm as milk, and all of a sudden I had a vision of - Drummond 
Street.  It came on me like a flash of lightning:  I simply 
returned thither, and into the past.  And when I remember all I 
hoped and feared as I pickled about Rutherford's in the rain and 
the east wind; how I feared I should make a mere shipwreck, and yet 
timidly hoped not; how I feared I should never have a friend, far 
less a wife, and yet passionately hoped I might; how I hoped (if I 
did not take to drink) I should possibly write one little book, 
etc. etc.  And then now - what a change!  I feel somehow as if I 
should like the incident set upon a brass plate at the corner of 
that dreary thoroughfare for all students to read, poor devils, 
when their hearts are down.  And I felt I must write one word to 
you.  Excuse me if I write little:  when I am at sea, it gives me a 
headache; when I am in port, I have my diary crying 'Give, give.'  
I shall have a fine book of travels, I feel sure; and will tell you 
more of the South Seas after very few months than any other writer 
has done - except Herman Melville perhaps, who is a howling cheese.  
Good luck to you, God bless you. - Your affectionate friend,
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p>FAKARAVA, LOW ARCHIPELAGO, SEPTEMBER 21ST, 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Only a word.  Get out your big atlas, and imagine 
a straight line from San Francisco to Anaho, the N.E. corner of 
Nukahiva, one of the Marquesas Islands; imagine three weeks there:  
imagine a day's sail on August 12th round the eastern end of the 
island to Tai-o-hae, the capital; imagine us there till August 
22nd:  imagine us skirt the east side of Ua-pu - perhaps Rona-Poa 
on your atlas - and through the Bondelais straits to Taaka-uku in 
Hiva-Oa, where we arrive on the 23rd; imagine us there until 
September 4th, when we sailed for Fakarava, which we reached on the 
9th, after a very difficult and dangerous passage among these 
isles.  Tuesday, we shall leave for Taiti, where I shall knock off 
and do some necessary work ashore.  It looks pretty bald in the 
atlas; not in fact; nor I trust in the 130 odd pages of diary which 
I have just been looking up for these dates:  the interest, indeed, 
has been INCREDIBLE:  I did not dream there were such places or 
such races.  My health has stood me splendidly; I am in for hours 
wading over the knees for shells; I have been five hours on 
horseback:  I have been up pretty near all night waiting to see 
where the CASCO would go ashore, and with my diary all ready - 
simply the most entertaining night of my life.  Withal I still have 
colds; I have one now, and feel pretty sick too; but not as at 
home:  instead of being in bed, for instance, I am at this moment 
sitting snuffling and writing in an undershirt and trousers; and as 
for colour, hands, arms, feet, legs, and face, I am browner than 
the berry:  only my trunk and the aristocratic spot on which I sit 
retain the vile whiteness of the north.
</p><p>Please give my news and kind love to Henley, Henry James, and any 
whom you see of well-wishers.  Accept from me the very best of my 
affection:  and believe me ever yours,
</p><p>THE OLD MAN VIRULENT.
</p><p>TAITI, OCTOBER 7TH, 1888.
</p><p>Never having found a chance to send this off, I may add more of my 
news.  My cold took a very bad turn, and I am pretty much out of 
sorts at this particular, living in a little bare one-twentieth-
furnished house, surrounded by mangoes, etc.  All the rest are 
well, and I mean to be soon.  But these Taiti colds are very severe 
and, to children, often fatal; so they were not the thing for me.  
Yesterday the brigantine came in from San Francisco, so we can get 
our letters off soon.  There are in Papeete at this moment, in a 
little wooden house with grated verandahs, two people who love you 
very much, and one of them is
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TAITI, AS EVER WAS, 6TH OCTOBER 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - . . . You will receive a lot of mostly very bad 
proofs of photographs:  the paper was so bad.  Please keep them 
very private, as they are for the book.  We send them, having 
learned so dread a fear of the sea, that we wish to put our eggs in 
different baskets.  We have been thrice within an ace of being 
ashore:  we were lost (!) for about twelve hours in the Low 
Archipelago, but by God's blessing had quiet weather all the time; 
and once, in a squall, we cam' so near gaun heels ower hurdies, 
that I really dinnae ken why we didnae athegither.  Hence, as I 
say, a great desire to put our eggs in different baskets, 
particularly on the Pacific (aw-haw-haw) Pacific Ocean.
</p><p>You can have no idea what a mean time we have had, owing to 
incidental beastlinesses, nor what a glorious, owing to the 
intrinsic interest of these isles.  I hope the book will be a good 
one; nor do I really very much doubt that - the stuff is so 
curious; what I wonder is, if the public will rise to it.  A copy 
of my journal, or as much of it as is made, shall go to you also; 
it is, of course, quite imperfect, much being to be added and 
corrected; but O, for the eggs in the different baskets.
</p><p>All the rest are well enough, and all have enjoyed the cruise so 
far, in spite of its drawbacks.  We have had an awfae time in some 
ways, Mr. Baxter; and if I wasnae sic a verra patient man (when I 
ken that I HAVE to be) there wad hae been a braw row; and ance if I 
hadnae happened to be on deck about three in the marnin', I THINK 
there would have been MURDER done.  The American Mairchant Marine 
is a kent service; ye'll have heard its praise, I'm thinkin'; an' 
if ye never did, ye can get TWA YEARS BEFORE THE MAST, by Dana, 
whaur forbye a great deal o' pleisure, ye'll get a' the needcessary 
information.  Love to your father and all the family. - Ever your 
affectionate friend,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TAITI, OCTOBER 10TH, 1888.
</p><p>DEAR GIVER, - I am at a loss to conceive your object in giving me 
to a person so locomotory as my proprietor.  The number of thousand 
miles that I have travelled, the strange bed-fellows with which I 
have been made acquainted, I lack the requisite literary talent to 
make clear to your imagination.  I speak of bed-fellows; pocket-
fellows would be a more exact expression, for the place of my abode 
is in my master's righthand trouser-pocket; and there, as he waded 
on the resounding beaches of Nukahiva, or in the shallow tepid 
water on the reef of Fakarava, I have been overwhelmed by and 
buried among all manner of abominable South Sea shells, beautiful 
enough in their way, I make no doubt, but singular company for any 
self-respecting paper-cutter.  He, my master - or as I more justly 
call him, my bearer; for although I occasionally serve him, does 
not he serve me daily and all day long, carrying me like an African 
potentate on my subject's legs? - HE is delighted with these isles, 
and this climate, and these savages, and a variety of other things.  
He now blows a flageolet with singular effects:  sometimes the poor 
thing appears stifled with shame, sometimes it screams with agony; 
he pursues his career with truculent insensibility.  Health appears 
to reign in the party.  I was very nearly sunk in a squall.  I am 
sorry I ever left England, for here there are no books to be had, 
and without books there is no stable situation for, dear Giver, 
your affectionate
</p><p>WOODEN PAPER-CUTTER.
</p><p>A neighbouring pair of scissors snips a kiss in your direction.

<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TAITI, OCTOBER 16TH, 1888.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - The cruiser for San Francisco departs to-morrow 
morning bearing you some kind of a scratch.  This much more 
important packet will travel by way of Auckland.  It contains a 
ballant; and I think a better ballant than I expected ever to do.  
I can imagine how you will wag your pow over it; and how ragged you 
will find it, etc., but has it not spirit all the same? and though 
the verse is not all your fancy painted it, has it not some life?  
And surely, as narrative, the thing has considerable merit!  Read 
it, get a typewritten copy taken, and send me that and your opinion 
to the Sandwiches.  I know I am only courting the most excruciating 
mortification; but the real cause of my sending the thing is that I 
could bear to go down myself, but not to have much MS. go down with 
me.  To say truth, we are through the most dangerous; but it has 
left in all minds a strong sense of insecurity, and we are all for 
putting eggs in various baskets.
</p><p>We leave here soon, bound for Uahiva, Reiatea, Bora-Bora, and the 
Sandwiches.
</p><p><br />
O, how my spirit languishes
To step ashore on the Sanguishes;
For there my letters wait,
There shall I know my fate.
O, how my spirit languidges
To step ashore on the Sanguidges.
</p><p><br />
18TH. - I think we shall leave here if all is well on Monday.  I am 
quite recovered, astonishingly recovered. It must be owned these 
climates and this voyage have given me more strength than I could 
have thought possible.  And yet the sea is a terrible place, 
stupefying to the mind and poisonous to the temper, the sea, the 
motion, the lack of space, the cruel publicity, the villainous 
tinned foods, the sailors, the captain, the passengers - but you 
are amply repaid when you sight an island, and drop anchor in a new 
world.  Much trouble has attended this trip, but I must confess 
more pleasure.  Nor should I ever complain, as in the last few 
weeks, with the curing of my illness indeed, as if that were the 
bursting of an abscess, the cloud has risen from my spirits and to 
some degree from my temper.  Do you know what they called the CASCO 
at Fakarava?  The SILVER SHIP.  Is that not pretty?  Pray tell Mrs. 
Jenkin, DIE SILBERNE FRAU, as I only learned it since I wrote her.  
I think of calling the book by that name:  THE CRUISE OF THE SILVER 
SHIP - so there will be one poetic page at least - the title.  At 
the Sandwiches we shall say farewell to the S. S. with mingled 
feelings.  She is a lovely creature:  the most beautiful thing at 
this moment in Taiti.
</p><p>Well, I will take another sheet, though I know I have nothing to 
say.  You would think I was bursting:  but the voyage is all stored 
up for the book, which is to pay for it, we fondly hope; and the 
troubles of the time are not worth telling; and our news is little.
</p><p>Here I conclude (Oct. 24th, I think), for we are now stored, and 
the Blue Peter metaphorically flies.
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO WILLIAM AND THOMAS ARCHER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TAITI, OCTOBER 17TH, 1888.
</p><p>DEAR ARCHER, - Though quite unable to write letters, I nobly send 
you a line signifying nothing.  The voyage has agreed well with 
all; it has had its pains, and its extraordinary pleasures; nothing 
in the world can equal the excitement of the first time you cast 
anchor in some bay of a tropical island, and the boats begin to 
surround you, and the tattooed people swarm aboard.  Tell 
Tomarcher, with my respex, that hide-and-seek is not equal to it; 
no, nor hidee-in-the-dark; which, for the matter of that, is a game 
for the unskilful:  the artist prefers daylight, a good-sized 
garden, some shrubbery, an open paddock, and - come on, Macduff.
</p><p>TOMARCHER, I am now a distinguished litterytour, but that was not 
the real bent of my genius.  I was the best player of hide-and-seek 
going; not a good runner, I was up to every shift and dodge, I 
could jink very well, I could crawl without any noise through 
leaves, I could hide under a carrot plant, it used to be my 
favourite boast that I always WALKED into the den.  You may care to 
hear, Tomarcher, about the children in these parts; their parents 
obey them, they do not obey their parents; and I am sorry to tell 
you (for I dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one) 
that it does not pay one halfpenny.  There are three sorts of 
civilisation, Tomarcher:  the real old-fashioned one, in which 
children either had to find out how to please their dear papas, or 
their dear papas cut their heads off.  This style did very well, 
but is now out of fashion.  Then the modern European style:  in 
which children have to behave reasonably well, and go to school and 
say their prayers, or their dear papas WILL KNOW THE REASON WHY.  
This does fairly well.  Then there is the South Sea Island plan, 
which does not do one bit.  The children beat their parents here; 
it does not make their parents any better; so do not try it.
</p><p>Dear Tomarcher, I have forgotten the address of your new house, but 
will send this to one of your papa's publishers.  Remember us all 
to all of you, and believe me, yours respectably,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>TAUTIRA (THE GARDEN OF THE WORLD), OTHERWISE CALLED HANS-CHRISTIAN-
ANDERSEN-VILLE [NOVEMBER 1888].
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Whether I have a penny left in the wide world, I 
know not, nor shall know, till I get to Honolulu, where I 
anticipate a devil of an awakening.  It will be from a mighty 
pleasant dream at least:  Tautira being mere Heaven.  But suppose, 
for the sake of argument, any money to be left in the hands of my 
painful doer, what is to be done with it?  Save us from exile would 
be the wise man's choice, I suppose; for the exile threatens to be 
eternal.  But yet I am of opinion - in case there should be SOME 
dibs in the hand of the P.D., I.E. painful doer; because if there 
be none, I shall take to my flageolet on the high-road, and work 
home the best way I can, having previously made away with my family 
- I am of opinion that if - and his are in the customary state, and 
you are thinking of an offering, and there should be still some 
funds over, you would be a real good P.D. to put some in with yours 
and tak' the credit o't, like a wee man!  I know it's a beastly 
thing to ask; but it, after all, does no earthly harm, only that 
much good.  And besides, like enough there's nothing in the till, 
and there is an end.  Yet I live here in the full lustre of 
millions; it is thought I am the richest son of man that has yet 
been to Tautira:  I! - and I am secretly eaten with the fear of 
lying in pawn, perhaps for the remainder of my days, in San 
Francisco.  As usual, my colds have much hashed my finances.
</p><p>Do tell Henley I write this just after having dismissed Ori the 
sub-chief, in whose house I live, Mrs. Ori, and Pairai, their 
adopted child, from the evening hour of music:  during which I 
Publickly (with a k) Blow on the Flageolet.  These are words of 
truth.  Yesterday I told Ori about W. E. H., counterfeited his 
playing on the piano and the pipe, and succeeded in sending the six 
feet four there is of that sub-chief somewhat sadly to his bed; 
feeling that his was not the genuine article after all.  Ori is 
exactly like a colonel in the Guards. - I am, dear Charles, ever

</p><p><br />
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Our mainmast is dry-rotten, and we are all to 
the devil; I shall lie in a debtor's jail.  Never mind, Tautira is 
first chop.  I am so besotted that I shall put on the back of this 
my attempt at words to Wandering Willie; if you can conceive at all 
the difficulty, you will also conceive the vanity with which I 
regard any kind of result; and whatever mine is like, it has some 
sense, and Burns's has none.
</p><p><br />
Home no more home to me, whither must I wander?
Hunger my driver, I go where I must.
Cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather;
Thick drives the rain, and my roof is in the dust.
Loved of wise men was the shade of my roof-tree.
The true word of welcome was spoken in the door -
Dear days of old, with the faces in the firelight,
Kind folks of old, you come again no more.
</p><p>Home was home then, my dear, full of kindly faces,
Home was home then, my dear, happy for the child.
Fire and the windows bright glittered on the moorland;
Song, tuneful song, built a palace in the wild.
Now, when day dawns on the brow of the moorland,
Lone stands the house, and the chimney-stone is cold.
Lone let it stand, now the friends are all departed,
The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the place of old.

<p><b>Letter:  TO J. A. SYMONDS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>NOVEMBER 11TH 1888.
</p><p>One November night, in the village of Tautira, we sat at the high 
table in the hall of assembly, hearing the natives sing.  It was 
dark in the hall, and very warm; though at times the land wind blew 
a little shrewdly through the chinks, and at times, through the 
larger openings, we could see the moonlight on the lawn.  As the 
songs arose in the rattling Tahitian chorus, the chief translated 
here and there a verse.  Farther on in the volume you shall read 
the songs themselves; and I am in hopes that not you only, but all 
who can find a savour in the ancient poetry of places, will read 
them with some pleasure.  You are to conceive us, therefore, in 
strange circumstances and very pleasing; in a strange land and 
climate, the most beautiful on earth; surrounded by a foreign race 
that all travellers have agreed to be the most engaging; and taking 
a double interest in two foreign arts.
</p><p>We came forth again at last, in a cloudy moonlight, on the forest 
lawn which is the street of Tautira.  The Pacific roared outside 
upon the reef.  Here and there one of the scattered palm-built 
lodges shone out under the shadow of the wood, the lamplight 
bursting through the crannies of the wall.  We went homeward 
slowly, Ori a Ori carrying behind us the lantern and the chairs, 
properties with which we had just been enacting our part of the 
distinguished visitor.  It was one of those moments in which minds 
not altogether churlish recall the names and deplore the absence of 
congenial friends; and it was your name that first rose upon our 
lips.  'How Symonds would have enjoyed this evening!' said one, and 
then another.  The word caught in my mind; I went to bed, and it 
was still there.  The glittering, frosty solitudes in which your 
days are cast arose before me:  I seemed to see you walking there 
in the late night, under the pine-trees and the stars; and I 
received the image with something like remorse.
</p><p>There is a modern attitude towards fortune; in this place I will 
not use a graver name.  Staunchly to withstand her buffets and to 
enjoy with equanimity her favours was the code of the virtuous of 
old.  Our fathers, it should seem, wondered and doubted how they 
had merited their misfortunes:  we, rather how we have deserved our 
happiness.  And we stand often abashed and sometimes revolted, at 
those partialities of fate by which we profit most.  It was so with 
me on that November night:  I felt that our positions should be 
changed.   It was you, dear Symonds, who should have gone upon that 
voyage and written this account.  With your rich stores of 
knowledge, you could have remarked and understood a thousand things 
of interest and beauty that escaped my ignorance; and the brilliant 
colours of your style would have carried into a thousand sickrooms 
the sea air and the strong sun of tropic islands.  It was otherwise 
decreed.  But suffer me at least to connect you, if only in name 
and only in the fondness of imagination, with the voyage of the 
'SILVER SHIP.'
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>DEAR SYMONDS, - I send you this (November 11th), the morning of its 
completion.  If I ever write an account of this voyage, may I place 
this letter at the beginning?  It represents - I need not tell you, 
for you too are an artist - a most genuine feeling, which kept me 
long awake last night; and though perhaps a little elaborate, I 
think it a good piece of writing.  We are IN HEAVEN HERE.  Do not 
forget

<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO THOMAS ARCHER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>TAUTIRA, ISLAND OF TAHITI [NOVEMBER 1888].
</p><p>DEAR TOMARCHER, - This is a pretty state of things! seven o'clock 
and no word of breakfast!  And I was awake a good deal last night, 
for it was full moon, and they had made a great fire of cocoa-nut 
husks down by the sea, and as we have no blinds or shutters, this 
kept my room very bright.  And then the rats had a wedding or a 
school-feast under my bed.  And then I woke early, and I have 
nothing to read except Virgil's AENEID, which is not good fun on an 
empty stomach, and a Latin dictionary, which is good for naught, 
and by some humorous accident, your dear papa's article on 
Skerryvore.  And I read the whole of that, and very impudent it is, 
but you must not tell your dear papa I said so, or it might come to 
a battle in which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued 
correspondent, or both, which would be prodigal.  And still no 
breakfast; so I said 'Let's write to Tomarcher.'
</p><p>This is a much better place for children than any I have hitherto 
seen in these seas.  The girls (and sometimes the boys) play a very 
elaborate kind of hopscotch.  The boys play horses exactly as we do 
in Europe; and have very good fun on stilts, trying to knock each 
other down, in which they do not often succeed.  The children of 
all ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please, 
running about the aisles, rolling balls, stealing mamma's bonnet 
and publicly sitting on it, and at last going to sleep in the 
middle of the floor.  I forgot to say that the whips to play 
horses, and the balls to roll about the church - at least I never 
saw them used elsewhere - grow ready made on trees; which is rough 
on toy-shops.  The whips are so good that I wanted to play horses 
myself; but no such luck! my hair is grey, and I am a great, big, 
ugly man.  The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite 
round.  When you grow up and become offensively rich, you can 
charter a ship in the port of London, and have it come back to you 
entirely loaded with these balls; when you could satisfy your mind 
as to their character, and give them away when done with to your 
uncles and aunts.  But what I really wanted to tell you was this:  
besides the tree-top toys (Hush-a-by, toy-shop, on the tree-top!), 
I have seen some real MADE toys, the first hitherto observed in the 
South Seas.
</p><p>This was how.  You are to imagine a four-wheeled gig; one horse; in 
the front seat two Tahiti natives, in their Sunday clothes, blue 
coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer than the Scotch) of a blue 
stuff with big white or yellow flowers, legs and feet bare; in the 
back seat me and my wife, who is a friend of yours; under our feet, 
plenty of lunch and things:  among us a great deal of fun in broken 
Tahitian, one of the natives, the sub-chief of the village, being a 
great ally of mine.  Indeed we have exchanged names; so that he is 
now called Rui, the nearest they can come to Louis, for they have 
no L and no S in their language.  Rui is six feet three in his 
stockings, and a magnificent man.  We all have straw hats, for the 
sun is strong.  We drive between the sea, which makes a great 
noise, and the mountains; the road is cut through a forest mostly 
of fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the place of our ivy, 
heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger than your head and 
far nicer, called Barbedine.  Presently we came to a house in a 
pretty garden, quite by itself, very nicely kept, the doors and 
windows open, no one about, and no noise but that of the sea.  It 
looked like a house in a fairy-tale, and just beyond we must ford a 
river, and there we saw the inhabitants.  Just in the mouth of the 
river, where it met the sea waves, they were ducking and bathing 
and screaming together like a covey of birds:  seven or eight 
little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long; and 
on the banks of the stream beside them, real toys - toy ships, full 
rigged, and with their sails set, though they were lying in the 
dust on their beam ends.  And then I knew for sure they were all 
children in a fairy-story, living alone together in that lonely 
house with the only toys in all the island; and that I had myself 
driven, in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy-story, 
and the question was, should I get out again?  But it was all 
right; I guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into the 
fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing vanished, and we 
drove on in our sea-side forest as before, and I have the honour to 
be Tomarcher's valued correspondent, TERIITEPA, which he was 
previously known as

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>YACHT 'CASCO,' AT SEA, 14TH JANUARY, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Twenty days out from Papeete.  Yes, sir, all 
that, and only (for a guess) in 4 degrees north or at the best 4 
degrees 30 minutes, though already the wind seems to smell a little 
of the North Pole.  My handwriting you must take as you get, for we 
are speeding along through a nasty swell, and I can only keep my 
place at the table by means of a foot against the divan, the 
unoccupied hand meanwhile gripping the ink-bottle.  As we begin (so 
very slowly) to draw near to seven months of correspondence, we are 
all in some fear; and I want to have letters written before I shall 
be plunged into that boiling pot of disagreeables which I 
constantly expect at Honolulu.  What is needful can be added there.
</p><p>We were kept two months at Tautira in the house of my dear old 
friend, Ori a Ori, till both the masts of this invaluable yacht had 
been repaired.  It was all for the best:  Tautira being the most 
beautiful spot, and its people the most amiable, I have ever found.  
Besides which, the climate suited me to the ground; I actually went 
sea-bathing almost every day, and in our feasts (we are all huge 
eaters in Taiarapu) have been known to apply four times for pig.  
And then again I got wonderful materials for my book, collected 
songs and legends on the spot; songs still sung in chorus by 
perhaps a hundred persons, not two of whom can agree on their 
translation; legends, on which I have seen half a dozen seniors 
sitting in conclave and debating what came next.  Once I went a 
day's journey to the other side of the island to Tati, the high 
chief of the Tevas - MY chief that is, for I am now a Teva and 
Teriitera, at your service - to collect more and correct what I had 
already.  In the meanwhile I got on with my work, almost finished 
the MASTER OF BALLANTRAE, which contains more human work than 
anything of mine but KIDNAPPED, and wrote the half of another 
ballad, the SONG OF RAHERO, on a Taiarapu legend of my own clan, 
sir - not so much fire as the FEAST OF FAMINE, but promising to be 
more even and correct.  But the best fortune of our stay at Tautira 
was my knowledge of Ori himself, one of the finest creatures 
extant.  The day of our parting was a sad one.  We deduced from it 
a rule for travellers:  not to stay two months in one place - which 
is to cultivate regrets.
</p><p>At last our contemptible ship was ready; to sea we went, bound for 
Honolulu and the letter-bag, on Christmas Day; and from then to now 
have experienced every sort of minor misfortune, squalls, calms, 
contrary winds and seas, pertinacious rains, declining stores, till 
we came almost to regard ourselves as in the case of Vanderdecken.  
Three days ago our luck seemed to improve, we struck a leading 
breeze, got creditably through the doldrums, and just as we looked 
to have the N.E. trades and a straight run, the rains and squalls 
and calms began again about midnight, and this morning, though 
there is breeze enough to send us along, we are beaten back by an 
obnoxious swell out of the north.  Here is a page of complaint, 
when a verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place.  For 
all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous weather, in 
the tail and circumference of hurricanes, and getting only 
annoyance where we should have had peril, and ill-humour instead of 
fear.
</p><p>I wonder if I have managed to give you any news this time, or 
whether the usual damn hangs over my letter?  'The midwife 
whispered, Be thou dull!' or at least inexplicit.  Anyway I have 
tried my best, am exhausted with the effort, and fall back into the 
land of generalities.  I cannot tell you how often we have planned 
our arrival at the Monument:  two nights ago, the 12th January, we 
had it all planned out, arrived in the lights and whirl of 
Waterloo, hailed a hansom, span up Waterloo Road, over the bridge, 
etc. etc., and hailed the Monument gate in triumph and with 
indescribable delight.  My dear Custodian, I always think we are 
too sparing of assurances:  Cordelia is only to be excused by Regan 
and Goneril in the same nursery; I wish to tell you that the longer 
I live, the more dear do you become to me; nor does my heart own 
any stronger sentiment.  If the bloody schooner didn't send me 
flying in every sort of direction at the same time, I would say 
better what I feel so much; but really, if you were here, you would 
not be writing letters, I believe; and even I, though of a more 
marine constitution, am much perturbed by this bobbery and wish - O 
ye Gods, how I wish! - that it was done, and we had arrived, and I 
had Pandora's Box (my mail bag) in hand, and was in the lively hope 
of something eatable for dinner instead of salt horse, tinned 
mutton, duff without any plums, and pie fruit, which now make up 
our whole repertory.  O Pandora's Box!  I wonder what you will 
contain.  As like as not you will contain but little money:  if 
that be so, we shall have to retire to 'Frisco in the CASCO, and 
thence by sea VIA Panama to Southampton, where we should arrive in 
April.  I would like fine to see you on the tug:  ten years older 
both of us than the last time you came to welcome Fanny and me to 
England.  If we have money, however, we shall do a little 
differently:  send the CASCO away from Honolulu empty of its high-
born lessees, for that voyage to 'Frisco is one long dead beat in 
foul and at last in cold weather; stay awhile behind, follow by 
steamer, cross the States by train, stay awhile in New York on 
business, and arrive probably by the German Line in Southampton.  
But all this is a question of money.  We shall have to lie very 
dark awhile to recruit our finances:  what comes from the book of 
the cruise, I do not want to touch until the capital is repaid.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, JANUARY 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - Here at last I have arrived.  We could not 
get away from Tahiti till Christmas Day, and then had thirty days 
of calms and squalls, a deplorable passage.  This has thrown me all 
out of gear in every way.  I plunge into business.
</p><p>1.  THE MASTER:  Herewith go three more parts.  You see he grows in 
balk; this making ten already, and I am not yet sure if I can 
finish it in an eleventh; which shall go to you QUAM PRIMUM - I 
hope by next mail.
</p><p>2.  ILLUSTRATIONS TO M.  I totally forgot to try to write to Hole.  
It was just as well, for I find it impossible to forecast with 
sufficient precision.  You had better throw off all this and let 
him have it at once.  PLEASE DO:  ALL, AND AT ONCE:  SEE FURTHER; 
and I should hope he would still be in time for the later numbers.  
The three pictures I have received are so truly good that I should 
bitterly regret having the volume imperfectly equipped.  They are 
the best illustrations I have seen since I don't know when.
</p><p>3.  MONEY.  To-morrow the mail comes in, and I hope it will bring 
me money either from you or home, but I will add a word on that 
point.
</p><p>4.  My address will be Honolulu - no longer Yacht CASCO, which I am 
packing off - till probably April.
</p><p>5.  As soon as I am through with THE MASTER, I shall finish the 
GAME OF BLUFF - now rechristened THE WRONG BOX.  This I wish to 
sell, cash down.  It is of course copyright in the States; and I 
offer it to you for five thousand dollars.  Please reply on this by 
return.  Also please tell the typewriter who was so good as to be 
amused by our follies that I am filled with admiration for his 
piece of work.
</p><p>6.  MASTER again.  Please see that I haven't the name of the 
Governor of New York wrong (1764 is the date) in part ten.  I have 
no book of reference to put me right.  Observe you now have up to 
August inclusive in hand, so you should begin to feel happy.
</p><p>Is this all?  I wonder, and fear not.  Henry the Trader has not yet 
turned up:  I hope he may to-morrow, when we expect a mail.  Not 
one word of business have I received either from the States or 
England, nor anything in the shape of coin; which leaves me in a 
fine uncertainty and quite penniless on these islands.  H.M. (who 
is a gentleman of a courtly order and much tinctured with letters) 
is very polite; I may possibly ask for the position of palace 
doorkeeper.  My voyage has been a singular mixture of good and ill-
fortune.  As far as regards interest and material, the fortune has 
been admirable; as far as regards time, money, and impediments of 
all kinds, from squalls and calms to rotten masts and sprung spars, 
simply detestable.  I hope you will be interested to hear of two 
volumes on the wing.  The cruise itself, you are to know, will make 
a big volume with appendices; some of it will first appear as (what 
they call) letters in some of M'Clure's papers.  I believe the book 
when ready will have a fair measure of serious interest:  I have 
had great fortune in finding old songs and ballads and stories, for 
instance, and have many singular instances of life in the last few 
years among these islands.
</p><p>The second volume is of ballads.  You know TICONDEROGA.  I have 
written another:  THE FEAST OF FAMINE, a Marquesan story.  A third 
is half done:  THE SONG OF RAHERO, a genuine Tahitian legend.  A 
fourth dances before me.  A Hawaiian fellow this, THE PRIEST'S 
DROUGHT, or some such name.  If, as I half suspect, I get enough 
subjects out of the islands, TICONDEROGA shall be suppressed, and 
we'll call the volume SOUTH SEA BALLADS.  In health, spirits, 
renewed interest in life, and, I do believe, refreshed capacity for 
work, the cruise has proved a wise folly.  Still we're not home, 
and (although the friend of a crowned head) are penniless upon 
these (as one of my correspondents used to call them) 'lovely but 
FATIL islands.'  By the way, who wrote the LION OF THE NILE?  My 
dear sir, that is Something Like.  Overdone in bits, it has a true 
thought and a true ring of language.  Beg the anonymous from me, to 
delete (when he shall republish) the two last verses, and end on 
'the lion of the Nile.'  One Lampman has a good sonnet on a 'Winter 
Evening' in, I think, the same number:  he seems ill named, but I 
am tempted to hope a man is not always answerable for his name.  
For instance, you would think you knew mine.  No such matter.  It 
is - at your service and Mr. Scribner's and that of all of the 
faithful - Teriitera (pray pronounce Tayree-Tayra) or (GALLICE) 
Teri-tera.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>More when the mail shall come.
</p><p>I am an idiot.  I want to be clear on one point.  Some of Hole's 
drawings must of course be too late; and yet they seem to me so 
excellent I would fain have the lot complete.  It is one thing for 
you to pay for drawings which are to appear in that soul-swallowing 
machine, your magazine:  quite another if they are only to 
illustrate a volume.  I wish you to take a brisk (even a fiery) 
decision on the point; and let Hole know.  To resume my desultory 
song, I desire you would carry the same fire (hereinbefore 
suggested) into your decision on the WRONG BOX; for in my present 
state of benighted ignorance as to my affairs for the last seven 
months - I know not even whether my house or my mother's house have 
been let - I desire to see something definite in front of me - 
outside the lot of palace doorkeeper.  I believe the said WRONG BOX 
is a real lark; in which, of course, I may be grievously deceived; 
but the typewriter is with me.  I may also be deceived as to the 
numbers of THE MASTER now going and already gone; but to me they 
seem First Chop, sir, First Chop.  I hope I shall pull off that 
damned ending; but it still depresses me:  this is your doing, Mr. 
Burlingame:  you would have it there and then, and I fear it - I 
fear that ending.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, FEBRUARY 8TH, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - Here we are at Honolulu, and have dismissed the 
yacht, and lie here till April anyway, in a fine state of haze, 
which I am yet in hopes some letter of yours (still on the way) may 
dissipate.  No money, and not one word as to money!  However, I 
have got the yacht paid off in triumph, I think; and though we stay 
here impignorate, it should not be for long, even if you bring us 
no extra help from home.  The cruise has been a great success, both 
as to matter, fun, and health; and yet, Lord, man! we're pleased to 
be ashore!  Yon was a very fine voyage from Tahiti up here, but - 
the dry land's a fine place too, and we don't mind squalls any 
longer, and eh, man, that's a great thing.  Blow, blow, thou wintry 
wind, thou hast done me no appreciable harm beyond a few grey 
hairs!  Altogether, this foolhardy venture is achieved; and if I 
have but nine months of life and any kind of health, I shall have 
both eaten my cake and got it back again with usury.  But, man, 
there have been days when I felt guilty, and thought I was in no 
position for the head of a house.
</p><p>Your letter and accounts are doubtless at S. F., and will reach me 
in course.  My wife is no great shakes; she is the one who has 
suffered most.  My mother has had a Huge Old Time; Lloyd is first 
chop; I so well that I do not know myself - sea-bathing, if you 
please, and what is far more dangerous, entertaining and being 
entertained by His Majesty here, who is a very fine intelligent 
fellow, but O, Charles! what a crop for the drink!  He carries it, 
too, like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders.  We 
calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours and a half 
(afternoon), and the sovereign quite presentable, although 
perceptibly more dignified at the end. . . .
</p><p>The extraordinary health I enjoy and variety of interests I find 
among these islands would tempt me to remain here; only for Lloyd, 
who is not well placed in such countries for a permanency; and a 
little for Colvin, to whom I feel I owe a sort of filial duty.  And 
these two considerations will no doubt bring me back - to go to bed 
again - in England. - Yours ever affectionately,

<p><b>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, HAWAIIAN ISLANDS, FEBRUARY 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR BOB, - My extremely foolhardy venture is practically over.  
How foolhardy it was I don't think I realised.  We had a very small 
schooner, and, like most yachts, over-rigged and over-sparred, and 
like many American yachts on a very dangerous sail plan.  The 
waters we sailed in are, of course, entirely unlighted, and very 
badly charted; in the Dangerous Archipelago, through which we were 
fools enough to go, we were perfectly in ignorance of where we were 
for a whole night and half the next day, and this in the midst of 
invisible islands and rapid and variable currents; and we were 
lucky when we found our whereabouts at last.  We have twice had all 
we wanted in the way of squalls:  once, as I came on deck, I found 
the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the 
companion like a brook to meet me; at that same moment the foresail 
sheet jammed and the captain had no knife; this was the only 
occasion on the cruise that ever I set a hand to a rope, but I 
worked like a Trojan, judging the possibility of haemorrhage better 
than the certainty of drowning.  Another time I saw a rather 
singular thing:  our whole ship's company as pale as paper from the 
captain to the cook; we had a black squall astern on the port side 
and a white squall ahead to starboard; the complication passed off 
innocuous, the black squall only fetching us with its tail, and the 
white one slewing off somewhere else.  Twice we were a long while 
(days) in the close vicinity of hurricane weather, but again luck 
prevailed, and we saw none of it.  These are dangers incident to 
these seas and small craft.  What was an amazement, and at the same 
time a powerful stroke of luck, both our masts were rotten, and we 
found it out - I was going to say in time, but it was stranger and 
luckier than that.  The head of the mainmast hung over so that 
hands were afraid to go to the helm; and less than three weeks 
before - I am not sure it was more than a fortnight - we had been 
nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of Eimeo (or Moorea, 
next island to Tahiti) in half a gale of wind with a violent head 
sea:  she would neither tack nor wear once, and had to be boxed off 
with the mainsail - you can imagine what an ungodly show of kites 
we carried - and yet the mast stood.  The very day after that, in 
the southern bight of Tahiti, we had a near squeak, the wind 
suddenly coming calm; the reefs were close in with, my eye! what a 
surf!  The pilot thought we were gone, and the captain had a boat 
cleared, when a lucky squall came to our rescue.  My wife, hearing 
the order given about the boats, remarked to my mother, 'Isn't that 
nice?  We shall soon be ashore!'  Thus does the female mind 
unconsciously skirt along the verge of eternity.  Our voyage up 
here was most disastrous - calms, squalls, head sea, waterspouts of 
rain, hurricane weather all about, and we in the midst of the 
hurricane season, when even the hopeful builder and owner of the 
yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her.  We ran out of food, 
and were quite given up for lost in Honolulu:  people had ceased to 
speak to Belle about the CASCO, as a deadly subject.
</p><p>But the perils of the deep were part of the programme; and though I 
am very glad to be done with them for a while and comfortably 
ashore, where a squall does not matter a snuff to any one, I feel 
pretty sure I shall want to get to sea again ere long.  The 
dreadful risk I took was financial, and double-headed.  First, I 
had to sink a lot of money in the cruise, and if I didn't get 
health, how was I to get it back?  I have got health to a wonderful 
extent; and as I have the most interesting matter for my book, bar 
accidents, I ought to get all I have laid out and a profit.  But, 
second (what I own I never considered till too late), there was the 
danger of collisions, of damages and heavy repairs, of disablement, 
towing, and salvage; indeed, the cruise might have turned round and 
cost me double.  Nor will this danger be quite over till I hear the 
yacht is in San Francisco; for though I have shaken the dust of her 
deck from my feet, I fear (as a point of law) she is still mine 
till she gets there.
</p><p>From my point of view, up to now the cruise has been a wonderful 
success.  I never knew the world was so amusing.  On the last 
voyage we had grown so used to sea-life that no one wearied, though 
it lasted a full month, except Fanny, who is always ill.  All the 
time our visits to the islands have been more like dreams than 
realities:  the people, the life, the beachcombers, the old stories 
and songs I have picked up, so interesting; the climate, the 
scenery, and (in some places) the women, so beautiful.  The women 
are handsomest in Tahiti, the men in the Marquesas; both as fine 
types as can be imagined.  Lloyd reminds me, I have not told you 
one characteristic incident of the cruise from a semi-naval point 
of view.  One night we were going ashore in Anaho Bay; the most 
awful noise on deck; the breakers distinctly audible in the cabin; 
and there I had to sit below, entertaining in my best style a 
negroid native chieftain, much the worse for rum!  You can imagine 
the evening's pleasure.
</p><p>This naval report on cruising in the South Seas would be incomplete 
without one other trait.  On our voyage up here I came one day into 
the dining-room, the hatch in the floor was open, the ship's boy 
was below with a baler, and two of the hands were carrying buckets 
as for a fire; this meant that the pumps had ceased working.
</p><p>One stirring day was that in which we sighted Hawaii.  It blew 
fair, but very strong; we carried jib, foresail, and mainsail, all 
single-reefed, and she carried her lee rail under water and flew.  
The swell, the heaviest I have ever been out in - I tried in vain 
to estimate the height, AT LEAST fifteen feet - came tearing after 
us about a point and a half off the wind.  We had the best hand - 
old Louis - at the wheel; and, really, he did nobly, and had noble 
luck, for it never caught us once.  At times it seemed we must have 
it; Louis would look over his shoulder with the queerest look and 
dive down his neck into his shoulders; and then it missed us 
somehow, and only sprays came over our quarter, turning the little 
outside lane of deck into a mill race as deep as to the cockpit 
coamings.  I never remember anything more delightful and exciting.  
Pretty soon after we were lying absolutely becalmed under the lee 
of Hawaii, of which we had been warned; and the captain never 
confessed he had done it on purpose, but when accused, he smiled.  
Really, I suppose he did quite right, for we stood committed to a 
dangerous race, and to bring her to the wind would have been rather 
a heart-sickening manoeuvre.

</p><p>DEAR SIR, - I thank you - from the midst of such a flurry as you 
can imagine, with seven months' accumulated correspondence on my 
table - for your two friendly and clever letters.  Pray write me 
again.  I shall be home in May or June, and not improbably shall 
come to Paris in the summer.  Then we can talk; or in the interval 
I may be able to write, which is to-day out of the question.  Pray 
take a word from a man of crushing occupations, and count it as a 
volume.  Your little CONTE is delightful.  Ah yes, you are right, I

</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - At last I have the accounts:  the Doer has done 
excellently, and in the words of -, 'I reciprocate every step of 
your behaviour.' . .  I send a letter for Bob in your care, as I 
don't know his Liverpool address, by which (for he is to show you 
part of it) you will see we have got out of this adventure - or 
hope to have - with wonderful fortune.  I have the retrospective 
horrors on me when I think of the liabilities I incurred; but, 
thank God, I think I'm in port again, and I have found one climate 
in which I can enjoy life.  Even Honolulu is too cold for me; but 
the south isles were a heaven upon earth to a puir, catarrhal party 
like Johns'one.  We think, as Tahiti is too complete a banishment, 
to try Madeira.  It's only a week from England, good 
communications, and I suspect in climate and scenery not unlike our 
dear islands; in people, alas! there can be no comparison.  But 
friends could go, and I could come in summer, so I should not be 
quite cut off.
</p><p>Lloyd and I have finished a story, THE WRONG BOX.  If it is not 
funny, I am sure I do not know what is.  I have split over writing 
it.  Since I have been here, I have been toiling like a galley 
slave:  three numbers of THE MASTER to rewrite, five chapters of 
the WRONG BOX to write and rewrite, and about five hundred lines of 
a narrative poem to write, rewrite, and re-rewrite.  Now I have THE 
MASTER waiting me for its continuation, two numbers more; when 
that's done, I shall breathe.  This spasm of activity has been 
chequered with champagne parties:  Happy and Glorious, Hawaii Ponoi 
paua:  kou moi - (Native Hawaiians, dote upon your monarch!) 
Hawaiian God save the King.  (In addition to my other labours, I am 
learning the language with a native moonshee.)  Kalakaua is a 
terrible companion; a bottle of fizz is like a glass of sherry to 
him, he thinks nothing of five or six in an afternoon as a whet for 
dinner.  You should see a photograph of our party after an 
afternoon with H. H. M.:  my! what a crew! - Yours ever

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU [MARCH 1889].
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES, - Yes - I own up - I am untrue to friendship and 
(what is less, but still considerable) to civilisation.  I am not 
coming home for another year.  There it is, cold and bald, and now 
you won't believe in me at all, and serve me right (says you) and 
the devil take me.  But look here, and judge me tenderly.  I have 
had more fun and pleasure of my life these past months than ever 
before, and more health than any time in ten long years.  And even 
here in Honolulu I have withered in the cold; and this precious 
deep is filled with islands, which we may still visit; and though 
the sea is a deathful place, I like to be there, and like squalls 
(when they are over); and to draw near to a new island, I cannot 
say how much I like.  In short, I take another year of this sort of 
life, and mean to try to work down among the poisoned arrows, and 
mean (if it may be) to come back again when the thing is through, 
and converse with Henry James as heretofore; and in the meanwhile 
issue directions to H. J. to write to me once more.  Let him 
address here at Honolulu, for my views are vague; and if it is sent 
here it will follow and find me, if I am to be found; and if I am 
not to be found the man James will have done his duty, and we shall 
be at the bottom of the sea, where no post-office clerk can be 
expected to discover us, or languishing on a coral island, the 
philosophic drudges of some barbarian potentate:  perchance, of an 
American Missionary.  My wife has just sent to Mrs. Sitwell a 
translation (TANT BIEN QUE MAL) of a letter I have had from my 
chief friend in this part of the world:  go and see her, and get a 
hearing of it; it will do you good; it is a better method of 
correspondence 'than even Henry James's.  I jest, but seriously it 
is a strange thing for a tough, sick, middle-aged scrivener like R. 
L. S. to receive a letter so conceived from a man fifty years old, 
a leading politician, a crack orator, and the great wit of his 
village:  boldly say, 'the highly popular M.P. of Tautira.'  My 
nineteenth century strikes here, and lies alongside of something 
beautiful and ancient.  I think the receipt of such a letter might 
humble, shall I say even -? and for me, I would rather have 
received it than written REDGAUNTLET or the SIXTH AENEID.  All 
told, if my books have enabled or helped me to make this voyage, to 
know Rui, and to have received such a letter, they have (in the old 
prefatorial expression) not been writ in vain.  It would seem from 
this that I have been not so much humbled as puffed up; but, I 
assure you, I have in fact been both.  A little of what that letter 
says is my own earning; not all, but yet a little; and the little 
makes me proud, and all the rest ashamed; and in the contrast, how 
much more beautiful altogether is the ancient man than him of to-
day!
</p><p>Well, well, Henry James is pretty good, though he IS of the 
nineteenth century, and that glaringly.  And to curry favour with 
him, I wish I could be more explicit; but, indeed, I am still of 
necessity extremely vague, and cannot tell what I am to do, nor 
where I am to go for some while yet.  As soon as I am sure, you 
shall hear.  All are fairly well - the wife, your countrywoman, 
least of all; troubles are not entirely wanting; but on the whole 
we prosper, and we are all affectionately yours,

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, APRIL 2ND, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am beginning to be ashamed of writing on to you 
without the least acknowledgment, like a tramp; but I do not care - 
I am hardened; and whatever be the cause of your silence, I mean to 
write till all is blue.  I am outright ashamed of my news, which is 
that we are not coming home for another year.  I cannot but hope it 
may continue the vast improvement of my health:  I think it good 
for Fanny and Lloyd; and we have all a taste for this wandering and 
dangerous life.  My mother I send home, to my relief, as this part 
of our cruise will be (if we can carry it out) rather difficult in 
places.  Here is the idea:  about the middle of June (unless the 
Boston Board objects) we sail from Honolulu in the missionary ship 
(barquentine auxiliary steamer) MORNING STAR:  she takes us through 
the Gilberts and Marshalls, and drops us (this is my great idea) on 
Ponape, one of the volcanic islands of the Carolines.  Here we stay 
marooned among a doubtful population, with a Spanish vice-governor 
and five native kings, and a sprinkling of missionaries all at 
loggerheads, on the chance of fetching a passage to Sydney in a 
trader, a labour ship, or (maybe, but this appears too bright) a 
ship of war.  If we can't get the MORNING STAR (and the Board has 
many reasons that I can see for refusing its permission) I mean to 
try to fetch Fiji, hire a schooner there, do the Fijis and 
Friendlies, hit the course of the RICHMOND at Tonga Tabu, make back 
by Tahiti, and so to S. F., and home:  perhaps in June 1890.  For 
the latter part of the cruise will likely be the same in either 
case.  You can see for yourself how much variety and adventure this 
promises, and that it is not devoid of danger at the best; but if 
we can pull it off in safety, gives me a fine book of travel, and 
Lloyd a fine lecture and diorama, which should vastly better our 
finances.
</p><p>I feel as if I were untrue to friendship; believe me, Colvin, when 
I look forward to this absence of another year, my conscience sinks 
at thought of the Monument; but I think you will pardon me if you 
consider how much this tropical weather mends my health.  Remember 
me as I was at home, and think of me sea-bathing and walking about, 
as jolly as a sandboy:  you will own the temptation is strong; and 
as the scheme, bar fatal accidents, is bound to pay into the 
bargain, sooner or later, it seems it would be madness to come home 
now, with an imperfect book, no illustrations to speak of, no 
diorama, and perhaps fall sick again by autumn.  I do not think I 
delude myself when I say the tendency to catarrh has visibly 
diminished.
</p><p>It is a singular tiring that as I was packing up old papers ere I 
left Skerryvore, I came on the prophecies of a drunken Highland 
sibyl, when I was seventeen.  She said I was to be very happy, to 
visit America, and TO BE MUCH UPON THE SEA.  It seems as if it were 
coming true with a vengeance.  Also, do you remember my strong, 
old, rooted belief that I shall die by drowning?  I don't want that 
to come true, though it is an easy death; but it occurs to me 
oddly, with these long chances in front.  I cannot say why I like 
the sea; no man is more cynically and constantly alive to its 
perils; I regard it as the highest form of gambling; and yet I love 
the sea as much as I hate gambling.  Fine, clean emotions; a world 
all and always beautiful; air better than wine; interest 
unflagging; there is upon the whole no better life. - Yours ever,

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[HONOLULU, APRIL 1889.]
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - This is to announce the most prodigious 
change of programme.  I have seen so much of the South Seas that I 
desire to see more, and I get so much health here that I dread a 
return to our vile climates.  I have applied accordingly to the 
missionary folk to let me go round in the MORNING STAR; and if the 
Boston Board should refuse, I shall get somehow to Fiji, hire a 
trading schooner, and see the Fijis and Friendlies and Samoa.  He 
would be a South Seayer, Mr. Burlingame.  Of course, if I go in the 
MORNING STAR, I see all the eastern (or western?) islands.
</p><p>Before I sail, I shall make out to let you have the last of THE 
MASTER:  though I tell you it sticks! - and I hope to have had some 
proofs forbye, of the verses anyway.  And now to business.
</p><p>I want (if you can find them) in the British sixpenny edition, if 
not, in some equally compact and portable shape - Seaside Library, 
for instance - the Waverley Novels entire, or as entire as you can 
get 'em, and the following of Marryat:  PHANTOM SHIP, PETER SIMPLE, 
PERCIVAL KEENE, PRIVATEERSMAN, CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST, FRANK 
MILDMAY, NEWTON FORSTER, DOG FIEND (SNARLEYYOW).  Also MIDSHIPMAN 
EASY, KINGSBURN, Carlyle's FRENCH REVOLUTION, Motley's DUTCH 
REPUBLIC, Lang's LETTERS ON LITERATURE, a complete set of my works, 
JENKIN, in duplicate; also FAMILIAR STUDIES, ditto.
</p><p>I have to thank you for the accounts, which are satisfactory 
indeed, and for the cheque for $1000.  Another account will have 
come and gone before I see you.  I hope it will be equally roseate 
in colour.  I am quite worked out, and this cursed end of THE 
MASTER hangs over me like the arm of the gallows; but it is always 
darkest before dawn, and no doubt the clouds will soon rise; but it 
is a difficult thing to write, above all in Mackellarese; and I 
cannot yet see my way clear.  If I pull this off, THE MASTER will 
be a pretty good novel or I am the more deceived; and even if I 
don't pull it off, it'll still have some stuff in it.
</p><p>We shall remain here until the middle of June anyway; but my mother 
leaves for Europe early in May.  Hence our mail should continue to 
come here; but not hers.  I will let you know my next address, 
which will probably be Sydney.  If we get on the MORNING STAR, I 
propose at present to get marooned on Ponape, and take my chance of 
getting a passage to Australia.  It will leave times and seasons 
mighty vague, and the cruise is risky; but I shall know something 
of the South Seas when it is done, or else the South Seas will 
contain all there is of me.  It should give me a fine book of 
travels, anyway.
</p><p>Low will probably come and ask some dollars of you.  Pray let him 
have them, they are for outfit.  O, another complete set of my 
books should go to Captain A. H. Otis, care of Dr. Merritt, Yacht 
CASCO, Oakland, Cal.  In haste,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, APRIL 6TH, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE, - Nobody writes a better letter than my 
Gamekeeper:  so gay, so pleasant, so engagingly particular, 
answering (by some delicate instinct) all the questions she 
suggests.  It is a shame you should get such a poor return as I can 
make, from a mind essentially and originally incapable of the art 
epistolary.  I would let the paper-cutter take my place; but I am 
sorry to say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of 
seamen, and deserted in the Societies.  The place he seems to have 
stayed at - seems, for his absence was not observed till we were 
near the Equator - was Tautira, and, I assure you, he displayed 
good taste, Tautira being as 'nigh hand heaven' as a paper-cutter 
or anybody has a right to expect.
</p><p>I think all our friends will be very angry with us, and I give the 
grounds of their probable displeasure bluntly - we are not coming 
home for another year.  My mother returns next month.  Fanny, 
Lloyd, and I push on again among the islands on a trading schooner, 
the EQUATOR - first for the Gilbert group, which we shall have an 
opportunity to explore thoroughly; then, if occasion serve, to the 
Marshalls and Carolines; and if occasion (or money) fail, to Samoa, 
and back to Tahiti.  I own we are deserters, but we have excuses.  
You cannot conceive how these climates agree with the wretched 
house-plant of Skerryvore:  he wonders to find himself sea-bathing, 
and cutting about the world loose, like a grown-up person.  They 
agree with Fanny too, who does not suffer from her rheumatism, and 
with Lloyd also.  And the interest of the islands is endless; and 
the sea, though I own it is a fearsome place, is very delightful.  
We had applied for places in the American missionary ship, the 
MORNING STAR, but this trading schooner is a far preferable idea, 
giving us more time and a thousandfold more liberty; so we 
determined to cut off the missionaries with a shilling.
</p><p>The Sandwich Islands do not interest us very much; we live here, 
oppressed with civilisation, and look for good things in the 
future.  But it would surprise you if you came out to-night from 
Honolulu (all shining with electric lights, and all in a bustle 
from the arrival of the mail, which is to carry you these lines) 
and crossed the long wooden causeway along the beach, and came out 
on the road through Kapiolani park, and seeing a gate in the 
palings, with a tub of gold-fish by the wayside, entered casually 
in.  The buildings stand in three groups by the edge of the beach, 
where an angry little spitfire sea continually spirts and thrashes 
with impotent irascibility, the big seas breaking further out upon 
the reef.  The first is a small house, with a very large summer 
parlour, or LANAI, as they call it here, roofed, but practically 
open.  There you will find the lamps burning and the family sitting 
about the table, dinner just done:  my mother, my wife, Lloyd, 
Belle, my wife's daughter, Austin her child, and to-night (by way 
of rarity) a guest.  All about the walls our South Sea curiosities, 
war clubs, idols, pearl shells, stone axes, etc.; and the walls are 
only a small part of a lanai, the rest being glazed or latticed 
windows, or mere open space.  You will see there no sign of the 
Squire, however; and being a person of a humane disposition, you 
will only glance in over the balcony railing at the merry-makers in 
the summer parlour, and proceed further afield after the Exile.  
You look round, there is beautiful green turf, many trees of an 
outlandish sort that drop thorns - look out if your feet are bare; 
but I beg your pardon, you have not been long enough in the South 
Seas - and many oleanders in full flower.  The next group of 
buildings is ramshackle, and quite dark; you make out a coach-house 
door, and look in - only some cocoanuts; you try round to the left 
and come to the sea front, where Venus and the moon are making 
luminous tracks on the water, and a great swell rolls and shines on 
the outer reef; and here is another door - all these places open 
from the outside - and you go in, and find photography, tubs of 
water, negatives steeping, a tap, and a chair and an inkbottle, 
where my wife is supposed to write; round a little further, a third 
door, entering which you find a picture upon the easel and a table 
sticky with paints; a fourth door admits you to a sort of court, 
where there is a hen sitting - I believe on a fallacious egg.  No 
sign of the Squire in all this.  But right opposite the studio door 
you have observed a third little house, from whose open door 
lamplight streams and makes hay of the strong moonlight shadows.  
You had supposed it made no part of the grounds, for a fence runs 
round it lined with oleander; but as the Squire is nowhere else, is 
it not just possible he may be here?  It is a grim little wooden 
shanty; cobwebs bedeck it; friendly mice inhabit its recesses; the 
mailed cockroach walks upon the wall; so also, I regret to say, the 
scorpion.  Herein are two pallet beds, two mosquito curtains, 
strung to the pitch-boards of the roof, two tables laden with books 
and manuscripts, three chairs, and, in one of the beds, the Squire 
busy writing to yourself, as it chances, and just at this moment 
somewhat bitten by mosquitoes.  He has just set fire to the insect 
powder, and will be all right in no time; but just now he 
contemplates large white blisters, and would like to scratch them, 
but knows better.  The house is not bare; it has been inhabited by 
Kanakas, and - you know what children are! - the bare wood walls 
are pasted over with pages from the GRAPHIC, HARPER'S WEEKLY, etc.  
The floor is matted, and I am bound to say the matting is filthy.  
There are two windows and two doors, one of which is condemned; on 
the panels of that last a sheet of paper is pinned up, and covered 
with writing.  I cull a few plums:-
</p><p><br />
'A duck-hammock for each person.
A patent organ like the commandant's at Taiohae.
Cheap and bad cigars for presents.
Revolvers.
Permanganate of potass.
Liniment for the head and sulphur.
Fine tooth-comb.'
</p><p><br />
What do you think this is?  Simply life in the South Seas 
foreshortened.  These are a few of our desiderata for the next 
trip, which we jot down as they occur.
</p><p>There, I have really done my best and tried to send something like 
a letter - one letter in return for all your dozens.  Pray remember 
us all to yourself, Mrs. Boodle, and the rest of your house.  I do 
hope your mother will be better when this comes.  I shall write and 
give you a new address when I have made up my mind as to the most 
probable, and I do beg you will continue to write from time to time 
and give us airs from home.  To-morrow - think of it - I must be 
off by a quarter to eight to drive in to the palace and breakfast 
with his Hawaiian Majesty at 8.30:  I shall be dead indeed.  Please 
give my news to Scott, I trust he is better; give him my warm 
regards.  To you we all send all kinds of things, and I am the 
absentee Squire,

</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - As usual, your letter is as good as a cordial, 
and I thank you for it, and all your care, kindness, and generous 
and thoughtful friendship, from my heart.  I was truly glad to hear 
a word of Colvin, whose long silence has terrified me; and glad to 
hear that you condoned the notion of my staying longer in the South 
Seas, for I have decided in that sense.  The first idea was to go 
in the MORNING STAR, missionary ship; but now I have found a 
trading schooner, the EQUATOR, which is to call for me here early 
in June and carry us through the Gilberts.  What will happen then, 
the Lord knows.  My mother does not accompany us:  she leaves here 
for home early in May, and you will hear of us from her; but not, I 
imagine, anything more definite.  We shall get dumped on 
Butaritari, and whether we manage to go on to the Marshalls and 
Carolines, or whether we fall back on Samoa, Heaven must decide; 
but I mean to fetch back into the course of the RICHMOND - (to 
think you don't know what the RICHMOND is! - the steamer of the 
Eastern South Seas, joining New Zealand, Tongatabu, the Samoas, 
Taheite, and Rarotonga, and carrying by last advices sheep in the 
saloon!) - into the course of the RICHMOND and make Taheite again 
on the home track.  Would I like to see the SCOTS OBSERVER?  
Wouldn't I not?  But whaur?  I'm direckit at space.  They have nae 
post offishes at the Gilberts, and as for the Car'lines!  Ye see, 
Mr. Baxter, we're no just in the punkshewal CENTRE o' civ'lisation.  
But pile them up for me, and when I've decided on an address, I'll 
let you ken, and ye'll can send them stavin' after me. - Ever your

hand that you have felt so much concern about the letter.  Pray 
dismiss it from your mind.  But I think you scarce appreciate how 
disagreeable it is to have your private affairs and private 
unguarded expressions getting into print.  It would soon sicken any 
one of writing letters.  I have no doubt that letter was very 
wisely selected, but it just shows how things crop up.  There was a 
raging jealousy between the two yachts; our captain was nearly in a 
fight over it.  However, no more; and whatever you think, my dear 
fellow, do not suppose me angry with you or -; although I was 
ANNOYED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE - a very different thing.  But it is 
difficult to conduct life by letter, and I continually feel I may 
be drifting into some matter of offence, in which my heart takes no 
part.
</p><p>I must now turn to a point of business.  This new cruise of ours is 
somewhat venturesome; and I think it needful to warn you not to be 
in a hurry to suppose us dead.  In these ill-charted seas, it is 
quite on the cards we might be cast on some unvisited, or very 
rarely visited, island; that there we might lie for a long time, 
even years, unheard of; and yet turn up smiling at the hinder end.  
So do not let me be 'rowpit' till you get some certainty we have 
gone to Davie Jones in a squall, or graced the feast of some 
barbarian in the character of Long Pig.
</p><p>I have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of Hawaii, the 
only white creature in many miles, riding five and a half hours one 
day, living with a native, seeing four lepers shipped off to 
Molokai, hearing native causes, and giving my opinion as AMICUS 
CURIAE as to the interpretation of a statute in English; a lovely 
week among God's best - at least God's sweetest works - 
Polynesians.  It has bettered me greatly.  If I could only stay 
there the time that remains, I could get my work done and be happy; 
but the care of my family keeps me in vile Honolulu, where I am 
always out of sorts, amidst heat and cold and cesspools and beastly 
HAOLES.  What is a haole?  You are one; and so, I am sorry to say, 
am I.  After so long a dose of whites, it was a blessing to get 
among Polynesians again even for a week.
</p><p>Well, Charles, there are waur haoles than yoursel', I'll say that 
for ye; and trust before I sail I shall get another letter with 
more about yourself. - Ever your affectionate friend
</p><p>R. L. S.

</p><p>HONOLULU, (ABOUT) 20TH MAY '89.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - The goods have come; many daughters have done 
virtuously, but thou excellest them all. - I have at length 
finished THE MASTER; it has been a sore cross to me; but now he is 
buried, his body's under hatches, - his soul, if there is any hell 
to go to, gone to hell; and I forgive him:  it is harder to forgive 
Burlingame for having induced me to begin the publication, or 
myself for suffering the induction. - Yes, I think Hole has done 
finely; it will be one of the most adequately illustrated books of 
our generation; he gets the note, he tells the story - MY story:  I 
know only one failure - the Master standing on the beach. - You 
must have a letter for me at Sydney - till further notice.  
Remember me to Mrs. Will. H., the godlike sculptor, and any of the 
faithful.  If you want to cease to be a republican, see my little 
Kaiulani, as she goes through - but she is gone already.  You will 
die a red, I wear the colours of that little royal maiden, NOUS 
ALLONS CHANTER A LA RONDE, SI VOUS VOULEZ! only she is not blonde 
by several chalks, though she is but a half-blood, and the wrong 
half Edinburgh Scots like mysel'.  But, O Low, I love the 
Polynesian:  this civilisation of ours is a dingy, ungentlemanly 
business; it drops out too much of man, and too much of that the 
very beauty of the poor beast:  who has his beauties in spite of 
Zola and Co.  As usual, here is a whole letter with no news:  I am 
a bloodless, inhuman dog; and no doubt Zola is a better 
correspondent. - Long live your fine old English admiral - yours, I 
mean - the U.S.A. one at Samoa; I wept tears and loved myself and 
mankind when I read of him:  he is not too much civilised.  And 
there was Gordon, too; and there are others, beyond question.  But 
if you could live, the only white folk, in a Polynesian village; 
and drink that warm, light VIN DU PAYS of human affection, and 
enjoy that simple dignity of all about you - I will not gush, for I 
am now in my fortieth year, which seems highly unjust, but there it 
is, Mr. Low, and the Lord enlighten your affectionate

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. R. L. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>KALAWAO, MOLOKAI [MAY 1889].
</p><p>DEAR FANNY, - I had a lovely sail up.  Captain Cameron and Mr. 
Gilfillan, both born in the States, yet the first still with a 
strong Highland, and the second still with a strong Lowland accent, 
were good company; the night was warm, the victuals plain but good.  
Mr. Gilfillan gave me his berth, and I slept well, though I heard 
the sisters sick in the next stateroom, poor souls.  Heavy rolling 
woke me in the morning; I turned in all standing, so went right on 
the upper deck.  The day was on the peep out of a low morning bank, 
and we were wallowing along under stupendous cliffs.  As the lights 
brightened, we could see certain abutments and buttresses on their 
front where wood clustered and grass grew brightly.  But the whole 
brow seemed quite impassable, and my heart sank at the sight.  Two 
thousand feet of rock making 19 degrees (the Captain guesses) 
seemed quite beyond my powers.  However, I had come so far; and, to 
tell you the truth, I was so cowed with fear and disgust that I 
dared not go back on the adventure in the interests of my own self-
respect.  Presently we came up with the leper promontory:  lowland, 
quite bare and bleak and harsh, a little town of wooden houses, two 
churches, a landing-stair, all unsightly, sour, northerly, lying 
athwart the sunrise, with the great wall of the pali cutting the 
world out on the south.  Our lepers were sent on the first boat, 
about a dozen, one poor child very horrid, one white man, leaving a 
large grown family behind him in Honolulu, and then into the second 
stepped the sisters and myself.  I do not know how it would have 
been with me had the sisters not been there.  My horror of the 
horrible is about my weakest point; but the moral loveliness at my 
elbow blotted all else out; and when I found that one of them was 
crying, poor soul, quietly under her veil, I cried a little myself; 
then I felt as right as a trivet, only a little crushed to be there 
so uselessly.  I thought it was a sin and a shame she should feel 
unhappy; I turned round to her, and said something like this:  
'Ladies, God Himself is here to give you welcome.  I'm sure it is 
good for me to be beside you; I hope it will be blessed to me; I 
thank you for myself and the good you do me.'  It seemed to cheer 
her up; but indeed I had scarce said it when we were at the 
landing-stairs, and there was a great crowd, hundreds of (God save 
us!) pantomime masks in poor human flesh, waiting to receive the 
sisters and the new patients.
</p><p>Every hand was offered:  I had gloves, but I had made up my mind on 
the boat's voyage NOT to give my hand; that seemed less offensive 
than the gloves.  So the sisters and I went up among that crew, and 
presently I got aside (for I felt I had no business there) and set 
off on foot across the promontory, carrying my wrap and the camera.  
All horror was quite gone from me:  to see these dread creatures 
smile and look happy was beautiful.  On my way through Kalaupapa I 
was exchanging cheerful ALOHAS with the patients coming galloping 
over on their horses; I was stopping to gossip at house-doors; I 
was happy, only ashamed of myself that I was here for no good.  One 
woman was pretty, and spoke good English, and was infinitely 
engaging and (in the old phrase) towardly; she thought I was the 
new white patient; and when she found I was only a visitor, a 
curious change came in her face and voice - the only sad thing, 
morally sad, I mean - that I met that morning.  But for all that, 
they tell me none want to leave.  Beyond Kalaupapa the houses 
became rare; dry stone dykes, grassy, stony land, one sick 
pandanus; a dreary country; from overhead in the little clinging 
wood shogs of the pali chirruping of birds fell; the low sun was 
right in my face; the trade blew pure and cool and delicious; I 
felt as right as ninepence, and stopped and chatted with the 
patients whom I still met on their horses, with not the least 
disgust.  About half-way over, I met the superintendent (a leper) 
with a horse for me, and O, wasn't I glad!  But the horse was one 
of those curious, dogged, cranky brutes that always dully want to 
go somewhere else, and my traffic with him completed my crushing 
fatigue.  I got to the guest-house, an empty house with several 
rooms, kitchen, bath, etc.  There was no one there, and I let the 
horse go loose in the garden, lay down on the bed, and fell asleep.
</p><p>Dr. Swift woke me and gave me breakfast, then I came back and slept 
again while he was at the dispensary, and he woke me for dinner; 
and I came back and slept again, and he woke me about six for 
supper; and then in about an hour I felt tired again, and came up 
to my solitary guest-house, played the flageolet, and am now 
writing to you.  As yet, you see, I have seen nothing of the 
settlement, and my crushing fatigue (though I believe that was 
moral and a measure of my cowardice) and the doctor's opinion make 
me think the pali hopeless.  'You don't look a strong man,' said 
the doctor; 'but are you sound?'  I told him the truth; then he 
said it was out of the question, and if I were to get up at all, I 
must be carried up.  But, as it seems, men as well as horses 
continually fall on this ascent:  the doctor goes up with a change 
of clothes - it is plain that to be carried would in itself be very 
fatiguing to both mind and body; and I should then be at the 
beginning of thirteen miles of mountain road to be ridden against 
time.  How should I come through?  I hope you will think me right 
in my decision:  I mean to stay, and shall not be back in Honolulu 
till Saturday, June first.  You must all do the best you can to 
make ready.
</p><p>Dr. Swift has a wife and an infant son, beginning to toddle and 
run, and they live here as composed as brick and mortar - at least 
the wife does, a Kentucky German, a fine enough creature, I 
believe, who was quite amazed at the sisters shedding tears!  How 
strange is mankind!  Gilfillan too, a good fellow I think, and far 
from a stupid, kept up his hard Lowland Scottish talk in the boat 
while the sister was covering her face; but I believe he knew, and 
did it (partly) in embarrassment, and part perhaps in mistaken 
kindness.  And that was one reason, too, why I made my speech to 
them.  Partly, too, I did it, because I was ashamed to do so, and 
remembered one of my golden rules, 'When you are ashamed to speak, 
speak up at once.'  But, mind you, that rule is only golden with 
strangers; with your own folks, there are other considerations.  
This is a strange place to be in.  A bell has been sounded at 
intervals while I wrote, now all is still but a musical humming of 
the sea, not unlike the sound of telegraph wires; the night is 
quite cool and pitch dark, with a small fine rain; one light over 
in the leper settlement, one cricket whistling in the garden, my 
lamp here by my bedside, and my pen cheeping between my inky 
fingers.
</p><p>Next day, lovely morning, slept all night, 80 degrees in the shade, 
strong, sweet Anaho trade-wind.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, JUNE 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am just home after twelve days journey to 
Molokai, seven of them at the leper settlement, where I can only 
say that the sight of so much courage, cheerfulness, and devotion 
strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the 
sights.  I used to ride over from Kalawao to Kalaupapa (about three 
miles across the promontory, the cliff-wall, ivied with forest and 
yet inaccessible from steepness, on my left), go to the Sisters' 
home, which is a miracle of neatness, play a game of croquet with 
seven leper girls (90 degrees in the shade), got a little old-maid 
meal served me by the Sisters, and ride home again, tired enough, 
but not too tired.  The girls have all dolls, and love dressing 
them.  You who know so many ladies delicately clad, and they who 
know so many dressmakers, please make it known it would be an 
acceptable gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the Reverend 
Sister Maryanne, Bishop Home, Kalaupapa, Molokai, Hawaiian Islands.
</p><p>I have seen sights that cannot be told, and heard stories that 
cannot be repeated:  yet I never admired my poor race so much, nor 
(strange as it may seem) loved life more than in the settlement.  A 
horror of moral beauty broods over the place:  that's like bad 
Victor Hugo, but it is the only way I can express the sense that 
lived with me all these days.  And this even though it was in great 
part Catholic, and my sympathies flew never with so much difficulty 
as towards Catholic virtues.  The pass-book kept with heaven stirs 
me to anger and laughter.  One of the sisters calls the place 'the 
ticket office to heaven.'  Well, what is the odds?  They do their 
darg and do it with kindness and efficiency incredible; and we must 
take folk's virtues as we find them, and love the better part.  Of 
old Damien, whose weaknesses and worse perhaps I heard fully, I 
think only the more.  It was a European peasant:  dirty, bigoted, 
untruthful, unwise, tricky, but superb with generosity, residual 
candour and fundamental good-humour:  convince him he had done 
wrong (it might take hours of insult) and he would undo what he had 
done and like his corrector better.  A man, with all the grime and 
paltriness of mankind, but a saint and hero all the more for that.  
The place as regards scenery is grand, gloomy, and bleak.  Mighty 
mountain walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island 
into a sea unusually deep; the front of the mountain ivied and 
furred with clinging forest, one viridescent cliff:  about half-way 
from east to west, the low, bare, stony promontory edged in between 
the cliff and the ocean; the two little towns (Kalawao and 
Kalaupapa) seated on either side of it, as bare almost as bathing 
machines upon a beach; and the population - gorgons and chimaeras 
dire.  All this tear of the nerves I bore admirably; and the day 
after I got away, rode twenty miles along the opposite coast and up 
into the mountains:  they call it twenty, I am doubtful of the 
figures:  I should guess it nearer twelve; but let me take credit 
for what residents allege; and I was riding again the day after, so 
I need say no more about health.  Honolulu does not agree with me 
at all:  I am always out of sorts there, with slight headache, 
blood to the head, etc.  I had a good deal of work to do and did it 
with miserable difficulty; and yet all the time I have been gaining 
strength, as you see, which is highly encouraging.  By the time I 
am done with this cruise I shall have the material for a very 
singular book of travels:  names of strange stories and characters, 
cannibals, pirates, ancient legends, old Polynesian poetry, - never 
was so generous a farrago.  I am going down now to get the story of 
a shipwrecked family, who were fifteen months on an island with a 
murderer:  there is a specimen.  The Pacific is a strange place; 
the nineteenth century only exists there in spots:  all round, it 
is a no man's land of the ages, a stir-about of epochs and races, 
barbarisms and civilisations, virtues and crimes.
</p><p>It is good of you to let me stay longer, but if I had known how ill 
you were, I should be now on my way home.  I had chartered my 
schooner and made all arrangements before (at last) we got definite 
news.  I feel highly guilty; I should be back to insult and worry 
you a little.  Our address till further notice is to be c/o R. 
Towns and Co., Sydney.  That is final:  I only got the arrangement 
made yesterday; but you may now publish it abroad. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO JAMES PAYN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HONOLULU, H.I., JUNE 13TH, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - I get sad news of you here at my offsetting 
for further voyages:  I wish I could say what I feel.  Sure there 
was never any man less deserved this calamity; for I have heard you 
speak time and again, and I remember nothing that was unkind, 
nothing that was untrue, nothing that was not helpful, from your 
lips.  It is the ill-talkers that should hear no more.  God knows, 
I know no word of consolation; but I do feel your trouble.  You are 
the more open to letters now; let me talk to you for two pages.  I 
have nothing but happiness to tell; and you may bless God you are a 
man so sound-hearted that (even in the freshness of your calamity) 
I can come to you with my own good fortune unashamed and secure of 
sympathy.  It is a good thing to be a good man, whether deaf or 
whether dumb; and of all our fellow-craftsmen (whom yet they count 
a jealous race), I never knew one but gave you the name of honesty 
and kindness:  come to think of it gravely, this is better than the 
finest hearing.  We are all on the march to deafness, blindness, 
and all conceivable and fatal disabilities; we shall not all get 
there with a report so good.  My good news is a health 
astonishingly reinstated.  This climate; these voyagings; these 
landfalls at dawn; new islands peaking from the morning bank; new 
forested harbours; new passing alarms of squalls and surf; new 
interests of gentle natives, - the whole tale of my life is better 
to me than any poem.
</p><p>I am fresh just now from the leper settlement of Molokai, playing 
croquet with seven leper girls, sitting and yarning with old, 
blind, leper beachcombers in the hospital, sickened with the 
spectacle of abhorrent suffering and deformation amongst the 
patients, touched to the heart by the sight of lovely and effective 
virtues in their helpers:  no stranger time have I ever had, nor 
any so moving.  I do not think it a little thing to be deaf, God 
knows, and God defend me from the same! - but to be a leper, of one 
of the self-condemned, how much more awful! and yet there's a way 
there also.  'There are Molokais everywhere,' said Mr. Dutton, 
Father Damien's dresser; you are but new landed in yours; and my 
dear and kind adviser, I wish you, with all my soul, that patience 
and courage which you will require.  Think of me meanwhile on a 
trading schooner, bound for the Gilbert Islands, thereafter for the 
Marshalls, with a diet of fish and cocoanut before me; bound on a 
cruise of - well, of investigation to what islands we can reach, 
and to get (some day or other) to Sydney, where a letter addressed 
to the care of R. Towns &amp; Co. will find me sooner or later; and if 
it contain any good news, whether of your welfare or the courage 
with which you bear the contrary, will do me good. - Yours 
affectionately (although so near a stranger),
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p><br />
</p><p>SCHOONER 'EQUATOR,' APAIANG LAGOON, AUGUST 22ND, 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - The missionary ship is outside the reef trying 
(vainly) to get in; so I may have a chance to get a line off.  I am 
glad to say I shall be home by June next for the summer, or we 
shall know the reason why.  For God's sake be well and jolly for 
the meeting.  I shall be, I believe, a different character from 
what you have seen this long while.  This cruise is up to now a 
huge success, being interesting, pleasant, and profitable.  The 
beachcomber is perhaps the most interesting character here; the 
natives are very different, on the whole, from Polynesians:  they 
are moral, stand-offish (for good reasons), and protected by a dark 
tongue.  It is delightful to meet the few Hawaiians (mostly 
missionaries) that are dotted about, with their Italian BRIO and 
their ready friendliness.  The whites are a strange lot, many of 
them good, kind, pleasant fellows; others quite the lowest I have 
ever seen even in the slums of cities.  I wish I had time to 
narrate to you the doings and character of three white murderers 
(more or less proven) I have met.  One, the only undoubted assassin 
of the lot, quite gained my affection in his big home out of a 
wreck, with his New Hebrides wife in her savage turban of hair and 
yet a perfect lady, and his three adorable little girls in Rob Roy 
Macgregor dresses, dancing to the hand organ, performing circus on 
the floor with startling effects of nudity, and curling up together 
on a mat to sleep, three sizes, three attitudes, three Rob Roy 
dresses, and six little clenched fists:  the murderer meanwhile 
brooding and gloating over his chicks, till your whole heart went 
out to him; and yet his crime on the face of it was dark:  
disembowelling, in his own house, an old man of seventy, and him 
drunk.
</p><p>It is lunch-time, I see, and I must close up with my warmest love 
to you.  I wish you were here to sit upon me when required.  Ah! if 
you were but a good sailor!  I will never leave the sea, I think; 
it is only there that a Briton lives:  my poor grandfather, it is 
from him I inherit the taste, I fancy, and he was round many 
islands in his day; but I, please God, shall beat him at that 
before the recall is sounded.  Would you be surprised to learn that 
I contemplate becoming a shipowner?  I do, but it is a secret.  
Life is far better fun than people dream who fall asleep among the 
chimney stacks and telegraph wires.
</p><p>Love to Henry James and others near. - Ever yours, my dear fellow,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>EQUATOR TOWN,  APEMAMA, OCTOBER 1889.
</p><p>No MORNING STAR came, however; and so now I try to send this to you 
by the schooner J. L. TIERNAN.  We have been about a month ashore, 
camping out in a kind of town the king set up for us:  on the idea 
that I was really a 'big chief' in England.  He dines with us 
sometimes, and sends up a cook for a share of our meals when he 
does not come himself.  This sounds like high living! alas, 
undeceive yourself.  Salt junk is the mainstay; a low island, 
except for cocoanuts, is just the same as a ship at sea:  brackish 
water, no supplies, and very little shelter.  The king is a great 
character - a thorough tyrant, very much of a gentleman, a poet, a 
musician, a historian, or perhaps rather more a genealogist - it is 
strange to see him lying in his house among a lot of wives (nominal 
wives) writing the History of Apemama in an account-book; his 
description of one of his own songs, which he sang to me himself, 
as 'about sweethearts, and trees, and the sea - and no true, all-
the-same lie,' seems about as compendious a definition of lyric 
poetry as a man could ask.  Tembinoka is here the great attraction:  
all the rest is heat and tedium and villainous dazzle, and yet more 
villainous mosquitoes.  We are like to be here, however, many a 
long week before we get away, and then whither?  A strange trade 
this voyaging:  so vague, so bound-down, so helpless.  Fanny has 
been planting some vegetables, and we have actually onions and 
radishes coming up:  ah, onion-despiser, were you but awhile in a 
low island, how your heart would leap at sight of a coster's 
barrow!  I think I could shed tears over a dish of turnips.  No 
doubt we shall all be glad to say farewell to low islands - I had 
near said for ever.  They are very tame; and I begin to read up the 
directory, and pine for an island with a profile, a running brook, 
or were it only a well among the rocks.  The thought of a mango 
came to me early this morning and set my greed on edge; but you do 
not know what a mango is, so -.
</p><p>I have been thinking a great deal of you and the Monument of late, 
and even tried to get my thoughts into a poem, hitherto without 
success.  God knows how you are:  I begin to weary dreadfully to 
see you - well, in nine months, I hope; but that seems a long time.  
I wonder what has befallen me too, that flimsy part of me that 
lives (or dwindles) in the public mind; and what has befallen THE 
MASTER, and what kind of a Box the Merry Box has been found.  It is 
odd to know nothing of all this.  We had an old woman to do devil-
work for you about a month ago, in a Chinaman's house on Apaiang 
(August 23rd or 24th).  You should have seen the crone with a noble 
masculine face, like that of an old crone [SIC], a body like a 
man's (naked all but the feathery female girdle), knotting cocoanut 
leaves and muttering spells:  Fanny and I, and the good captain of 
the EQUATOR, and the Chinaman and his native wife and sister-in-
law, all squatting on the floor about the sibyl; and a crowd of 
dark faces watching from behind her shoulder (she sat right in the 
doorway) and tittering aloud with strange, appalled, embarrassed 
laughter at each fresh adjuration.  She informed us you were in 
England, not travelling and now no longer sick; she promised us a 
fair wind the next day, and we had it, so I cherish the hope she 
was as right about Sidney Colvin.  The shipownering has rather 
petered out since I last wrote, and a good many other plans beside.
</p><p>Health?  Fanny very so-so; I pretty right upon the whole, and 
getting through plenty work:  I know not quite how, but it seems to 
me not bad and in places funny.

my travel book; and the yarns are good, I do believe.  THE PEARL 
FISHER is for the NEW YORK LEDGER:  the yarn is a kind of Monte

the characters seem to me good.  THE BEACHCOMBERS is more 
sentimental.  These three scarce touch the outskirts of the life we 
have been viewing; a hot-bed of strange characters and incidents:

</p><p>SCHOONER 'EQUATOR,' AT SEA. 190 MILES OFF SAMOA.  MONDAY, DECEMBER 
2ND, 1889
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - We are just nearing the end of our long cruise.  
Rain, calms, squalls, bang - there's the foretopmast gone; rain, 
calm, squalls, away with the staysail; more rain, more calm, more 
squalls; a prodigious heavy sea all the time, and the EQUATOR 
staggering and hovering like a swallow in a storm; and the cabin, a 
great square, crowded with wet human beings, and the rain 
avalanching on the deck, and the leaks dripping everywhere:  Fanny, 
in the midst of fifteen males, bearing up wonderfully.  But such 
voyages are at the best a trial.  We had one particularity:  coming 
down on Winslow Reef, p. d. (position doubtful):  two positions in 
the directory, a third (if you cared to count that) on the chart; 
heavy sea running, and the night due.  The boats were cleared, 
bread put on board, and we made up our packets for a boat voyage of 
four or five hundred miles, and turned in, expectant of a crash.  
Needless to say it did not come, and no doubt we were far to 
leeward.  If we only had twopenceworth of wind, we might be at 
dinner in Apia to-morrow evening; but no such luck:  here we roll, 
dead before a light air - and that is no point of sailing at all 
for a fore and aft schooner - the sun blazing overhead, thermometer 
88 degrees, four degrees above what I have learned to call South 
Sea temperature; but for all that, land so near, and so much grief 
being happily astern, we are all pretty gay on board, and have been 
photographing and draught-playing and sky-larking like anything.  I 
am minded to stay not very long in Samoa and confine my studies 
there (as far as any one can forecast) to the history of the late 
war.  My book is now practically modelled:  if I can execute what 
is designed, there are few better books now extant on this globe, 
bar the epics, and the big tragedies, and histories, and the choice 
lyric poetics and a novel or so - none.  But it is not executed 
yet; and let not him that putteth on his armour, vaunt himself.  At 
least, nobody has had such stuff; such wild stories, such beautiful 
scenes, such singular intimacies, such manners and traditions, so 
incredible a mixture of the beautiful and horrible, the savage and 
civilised.  I will give you here some idea of the table of 
contents, which ought to make your mouth water.  I propose to call 
the book THE SOUTH SEAS:  it is rather a large title, but not many 
people have seen more of them than I, perhaps no one - certainly no 
one capable of using the material.

be accounted for:  I think it will be all history, and I shall work 
in observations on Samoan manners, under the similar heads in other 
Polynesian islands.  It is still possible, though unlikely, that I 
may add a passing visit to Fiji or Tonga, or even both; but I am 
growing impatient to see yourself, and I do not want to be later 
than June of coming to England.  Anyway, you see it will be a large 
work, and as it will be copiously illustrated, the Lord knows what 
it will cost.  We shall return, God willing, by Sydney, Ceylon, 
Suez and, I guess, Marseilles the many-masted (copyright epithet).  
I shall likely pause a day or two in Paris, but all that is too far 
ahead - although now it begins to look near - so near, and I can 
hear the rattle of the hansom up Endell Street, and see the gates 
swing back, and feel myself jump out upon the Monument steps - 
Hosanna! - home again.  My dear fellow, now that my father is done 
with his troubles, and 17 Heriot Row no more than a mere shell, you 
and that gaunt old Monument in Bloomsbury are all that I have in 
view when I use the word home; some passing thoughts there may be 
of the rooms at Skerryvore, and the black-birds in the chine on a 
May morning; but the essence is S. C. and the Museum.  Suppose, by 
some damned accident, you were no more:  well, I should return just 
the same, because of my mother and Lloyd, whom I now think to send 
to Cambridge; but all the spring would have gone out of me, and 
ninety per cent. of the attraction lost.  I will copy for you here 
a copy of verses made in Apemama.
</p><p><br />
I heard the pulse of the besieging sea
Throb far away all night.  I heard the wind
Fly crying, and convulse tumultuous palms.
I rose and strolled.  The isle was all bright sand,
And flailing fans and shadows of the palm:
The heaven all moon, and wind, and the blind vault -
The keenest planet slain, for Venus slept.
The King, my neighbour, with his host of wives,
Slept in the precinct of the palisade:
Where single, in the wind, under the moon,
Among the slumbering cabins, blazed a fire,
Sole street-lamp and the only sentinel.
To other lands and nights my fancy turned,
To London first, and chiefly to your house,
The many-pillared and the well-beloved.
There yearning fancy lighted; there again
In the upper room I lay and heard far off
The unsleeping city murmur like a shell;
The muffled tramp of the Museum guard
Once more went by me; I beheld again
Lamps vainly brighten the dispeopled street;
Again I longed for the returning morn,
The awaking traffic, the bestirring birds,
The consentaneous trill of tiny song
That weaves round monumental cornices
A passing charm of beauty:  most of all,
For your light foot I wearied, and your knock
That was the glad reveille of my day.
Lo, now, when to your task in the great house
At morning through the portico you pass,
One moment glance where, by the pillared wall,
Far-voyaging island gods, begrimed with smoke,
Sit now unworshipped, the rude monument
Of faiths forgot and races undivined;
Sit now disconsolate, remembering well
The priest, the victim, and the songful crowd,
The blaze of the blue noon, and that huge voice
Incessant, of the breakers on the shore.
As far as these from their ancestral shrine,
So far, so foreign, your divided friends
Wander, estranged in body, not in mind.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SCHOONER 'EQUATOR,' AT SEA, WEDNESDAY, 4TH DECEMBER 1889.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - We are now about to rise, like whales, from 
this long dive, and I make ready a communication which is to go to 
you by the first mail from Samoa.  How long we shall stay in that 
group I cannot forecast; but it will be best still to address at 
Sydney, where I trust, when I shall arrive, perhaps in one month 
from now, more probably in two or three, to find all news.
</p><p>BUSINESS. - Will you be likely to have a space in the Magazine for 
a serial story, which should be, ready, I believe, by April, at 
latest by autumn?  It is called THE WRECKER; and in book form will 
appear as number 1 of South Sea Yarns by R. L. S. and Lloyd 
Osbourne.  Here is the table as far as fully conceived, and indeed 
executed. ...
</p><p>The story is founded on fact, the mystery I really believe to be 
insoluble; the purchase of a wreck has never been handled before, 
no more has San Francisco.  These seem all elements of success.  
There is, besides, a character, Jim Pinkerton, of the advertising 
American, on whom we build a good deal; and some sketches of the 
American merchant marine, opium smuggling in Honolulu, etc.  It 
should run to (about) three hundred pages of my MS.  I would like 
to know if this tale smiles upon you, if you will have a vacancy, 
and what you will be willing to pay.  It will of course be 
copyright in both the States and England.  I am a little anxious to 
have it tried serially, as it tests the interest of the mystery.
</p><p>PLEASURE. - We have had a fine time in the Gilbert group, though 
four months on low islands, which involves low diet, is a largish 
order; and my wife is rather down.  I am myself, up to now, a 
pillar of health, though our long and vile voyage of calms, 
squalls, cataracts of rain, sails carried away, foretopmast lost, 
boats cleared and packets made on the approach of a p. d. reef, 
etc., has cured me of salt brine, and filled me with a longing for 
beef steak and mangoes not to be depicted.  The interest has been 
immense.  Old King Tembinoka of Apemama, the Napoleon of the group, 
poet, tyrant, altogether a man of mark, gave me the woven corselets 
of his grandfather, his father and his uncle, and, what pleased me 
more, told me their singular story, then all manner of strange 
tales, facts and experiences for my South Sea book, which should be 
a Tearer, Mr. Burlingame:  no one at least has had such stuff.
</p><p>We are now engaged in the hell of a dead calm, the heat is cruel - 
it is the only time when I suffer from heat:  I have nothing on but 
a pair of serge trousers, and a singlet without sleeves of Oxford 
gauze - O, yes, and a red sash about my waist; and yet as I sit 
here in the cabin, sweat streams from me.  The rest are on deck 
under a bit of awning; we are not much above a hundred miles from 
port, and we might as well be in Kamschatka.  However, I should be 
honest:  this is the first calm I have endured without the added 
bane of a heavy swell, and the intoxicated blue-bottle wallowings 
and knockings of the helpless ship.
</p><p>I wonder how you liked the end of THE MASTER; that was the hardest 
job I ever had to do; did I do it?
</p><p>My wife begs to be remembered to yourself and Mrs. Burlingame.  
Remember all of us to all friends, particularly Low, in case I 
don't get a word through for him. - I am, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SAMOA, [DECEMBER 1889].
</p><p>MY DEAR BAXTER, - . . . I cannot return until I have seen either 
Tonga or Fiji or both:  and I must not leave here till I have 
finished my collections on the war - a very interesting bit of 
history, the truth often very hard to come at, and the search (for 
me) much complicated by the German tongue, from the use of which I 
have desisted (I suppose) these fifteen years.  The last two days I 
have been mugging with a dictionary from five to six hours a day; 
besides this, I have to call upon, keep sweet, and judiciously 
interview all sorts of persons - English, American, German, and 
Samoan.  It makes a hard life; above all, as after every interview 
I have to come and get my notes straight on the nail.  I believe I 
should have got my facts before the end of January, when I shall 
make our Tonga or Fiji.  I am down right in the hurricane season; 
but they had so bad a one last year, I don't imagine there will be 
much of an edition this.  Say that I get to Sydney some time in 
April, and I shall have done well, and be in a position to write a 
very singular and interesting book, or rather two; for I shall 
begin, I think, with a separate opuscule on the Samoan Trouble, 
about as long as KIDNAPPED, not very interesting, but valuable - 
and a thing proper to be done.  And then, hey! for the big South 
Sea Book:  a devil of a big one, and full of the finest sport.
</p><p>This morning as I was going along to my breakfast a little before 
seven, reading a number of BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE, I was startled by 
a soft TALOFA, ALII (note for my mother:  they are quite courteous 
here in the European style, quite unlike Tahiti), right in my ear:  
it was Mataafa coming from early mass in his white coat and white 
linen kilt, with three fellows behind him.  Mataafa is the nearest 
thing to a hero in my history, and really a fine fellow; plenty 
sense, and the most dignified, quiet, gentle manners.  Talking of 
BLACKWOOD - a file of which I was lucky enough to find here in the 
lawyer's - Mrs. Oliphant seems in a staggering state:  from the 
WRONG BOX to THE MASTER I scarce recognise either my critic or 
myself.  I gather that THE MASTER should do well, and at least that 
notice is agreeable reading.  I expect to be home in June:  you 
will have gathered that I am pretty well.  In addition to my 
labours, I suppose I walk five or six miles a day, and almost every 
day I ride up and see Fanny and Lloyd, who are in a house in the 
bush with Ah Fu.  I live in Apia for history's sake with Moors, an 
American trader.  Day before yesterday I was arrested and fined for 
riding fast in the street, which made my blood bitter, as the wife 
of the manager of the German Firm has twice almost ridden me down, 
and there seems none to say her nay.  The Germans have behaved 
pretty badly here, but not in all ways so ill as you may have 
gathered:  they were doubtless much provoked; and if the insane 
Knappe had not appeared upon the scene, might have got out of the 
muddle with dignity.  I write along without rhyme or reason, as 
things occur to me.
</p><p>I hope from my outcries about printing you do not think I want you 
to keep my news or letters in a Blue Beard closet.  I like all 
friends to hear of me; they all should if I had ninety hours in the 
day, and strength for all of them; but you must have gathered how 
hard worked I am, and you will understand I go to bed a pretty 
tired man.
</p><p>29TH DECEMBER, [1889].
</p><p>To-morrow (Monday, I won't swear to my day of the month; this is 
the Sunday between Christmas and New Year) I go up the coast with 
Mr. Clarke, one of the London Society missionaries, in a boat to 
examine schools, see Tamasese, etc.  Lloyd comes to photograph.  
Pray Heaven we have good weather; this is the rainy season; we 
shall be gone four or five days; and if the rain keep off, I shall 
be glad of the change; if it rain, it will be beastly.  This 
explains still further how hard pressed I am, as the mail will be 
gone ere I return, and I have thus lost the days I meant to write 
in.  I have a boy, Henry, who interprets and copies for me, and is 
a great nuisance.  He said he wished to come to me in order to 
learn 'long expressions.'  Henry goes up along with us; and as I am 
not fond of him, he may before the trip is over hear some 'strong 
expressions.'  I am writing this on the back balcony at Moors', 
palms and a hill like the hill of Kinnoull looking in at me; myself 
lying on the floor, and (like the parties in Handel's song) 'clad 
in robes of virgin white'; the ink is dreadful, the heat delicious, 
a fine going breeze in the palms, and from the other side of the 
house the sudden angry splash and roar of the Pacific on the reef, 
where the warships are still piled from last year's hurricane, some 
under water, one high and dry upon her side, the strangest figure 
of a ship was ever witnessed; the narrow bay there is full of 
ships; the men-of-war covered with sail after the rains, and 
(especially the German ship, which is fearfully and awfully top 
heavy) rolling almost yards in, in what appears to be calm water.
</p><p>Samoa, Apia at least, is far less beautiful than the Marquesas or 
Tahiti:  a more gentle scene, gentler acclivities, a tamer face of 
nature; and this much aided, for the wanderer, by the great German 
plantations with their countless regular avenues of palms.  The 
island has beautiful rivers, of about the bigness of our waters in 
the Lothians, with pleasant pools and waterfalls and overhanging 
verdure, and often a great volume of sound, so that once I thought 
I was passing near a mill, and it was only the voice of the river.  
I am not specially attracted by the people; but they are courteous; 
the women very attractive, and dress lovely; the men purposelike, 
well set up, tall, lean, and dignified.  As I write the breeze is 
brisking up, doors are beginning to slam:  and shutters; a strong 
draught sweeps round the balcony; it looks doubtful for to-morrow.  
Here I shut up. - Ever your affectionate,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO DR. SCOTT</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>APIA, SAMOA, JANUARY 20TH, 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR SCOTT, - Shameful indeed that you should not have heard of 
me before!  I have now been some twenty months in the South Seas, 
and am (up to date) a person whom you would scarce know.  I think 
nothing of long walks and rides:  I was four hours and a half gone 
the other day, partly riding, partly climbing up a steep ravine.  I 
have stood a six months' voyage on a copra schooner with about 
three months ashore on coral atolls, which means (except for 
cocoanuts to drink) no change whatever from ship's food.  My wife 
suffered badly - it was too rough a business altogether - Lloyd 
suffered - and, in short, I was the only one of the party who 'kept 
my end up.'
</p><p>I am so pleased with this climate that I have decided to settle; 
have even purchased a piece of land from three to four hundred 
acres, I know not which till the survey is completed, and shall 
only return next summer to wind up my affairs in England; 
thenceforth I mean to be a subject of the High Commissioner.
</p><p>Now you would have gone longer yet without news of your truant 
patient, but that I have a medical discovery to communicate.  I 
find I can (almost immediately) fight off a cold with liquid 
extract of coca; two or (if obstinate) three teaspoonfuls in the 
day for a variable period of from one to five days sees the cold 
generally to the door.  I find it at once produces a glow, stops 
rigour, and though it makes one very uncomfortable, prevents the 
advance of the disease.  Hearing of this influenza, it occurred to 
me that this might prove remedial; and perhaps a stronger 
exhibition - injections of cocaine, for instance - still better.
</p><p>If on my return I find myself let in for this epidemic, which seems 
highly calculated to nip me in the bud, I shall feel very much 
inclined to make the experiment.  See what a gulf you may save me 
from if you shall have previously made it on ANIMA VILI, on some 
less important sufferer, and shall have found it worse than 
useless.
</p><p>How is Miss Boodle and her family?  Greeting to your brother and 
all friends in Bournemouth, yours very sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>FEBRUAR DEN 3EN 1890.
DAMPFER LUBECK ZWISCHEN APIA UND SYDNEY.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - I have got one delightful letter from you, and 
heard from my mother of your kindness in going to see her.  Thank 
you for that:  you can in no way more touch and serve me. . . . Ay, 
ay, it is sad to sell 17; sad and fine were the old days:  when I 
was away in Apemama, I wrote two copies of verse about Edinburgh 
and the past, so ink black, so golden bright.  I will send them, if 
I can find them, for they will say something to you, and indeed one 
is more than half addressed to you.  This is it -
</p><p><br />
TO MY OLD COMRADES
</p><p><br />
Do you remember - can we e'er forget? -
How, in the coiled perplexities of youth,
In our wild climate, in our scowling town,
We gloomed and shivered, sorrowed, sobbed, and feared?
The belching winter wind, the missile rain,
The rare and welcome silence of the snows,
The laggard morn, the haggard day, the night,
The grimy spell of the nocturnal town,
Do you remember? - Ah, could one forget!
As when the fevered sick that all night long
Listed the wind intone, and hear at last
The ever-welcome voice of the chanticleer
Sing in the bitter hour before the dawn, -
With sudden ardour, these desire the day:
</p><p>(Here a squall sends all flying.)
</p><p>So sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope;
So we, exulting, hearkened and desired.
For lo! as in the palace porch of life
We huddled with chimeras, from within -
How sweet to hear! - the music swelled and fell,
And through the breach of the revolving doors
What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled!
I have since then contended and rejoiced;
Amid the glories of the house of life
Profoundly entered, and the shrine beheld:
Yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes
Shall dwindle and recede, the voice of love
Fall insignificant on my closing ears,
What sound shall come but the old cry of the wind
In our inclement city? what return
But the image of the emptiness of youth,
Filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice
Of discontent and rapture and despair?
So, as in darkness, from the magic lamp,
The momentary pictures gleam and fade
And perish, and the night resurges - these
Shall I remember, and then all forget.
</p><p><br />
They're pretty second-rate, but felt.  I can't be bothered to copy 
the other.
</p><p>I have bought 314 and a half acres of beautiful land in the bush 
behind Apia; when we get the house built, the garden laid, and 
cattle in the place, it will be something to fall back on for 
shelter and food; and if the island could stumble into political 
quiet, it is conceivable it might even bring a little income. . . . 
We range from 600 to 1500 feet, have five streams, waterfalls, 
precipices, profound ravines, rich tablelands, fifty head of cattle 
on the ground (if any one could catch them), a great view of 
forest, sea, mountains, the warships in the haven:  really a noble 
place.  Some day you are to take a long holiday and come and see 
us:  it has been all planned.
</p><p>With all these irons in the fire, and cloudy prospects, you may be 
sure I was pleased to hear a good account of business.  I believed 
THE MASTER was a sure card:  I wonder why Henley thinks it grimy; 
grim it is, God knows, but sure not grimy, else I am the more 
deceived.  I am sorry he did not care for it; I place it on the 
line with KIDNAPPED myself.  We'll see as time goes on whether it 
goes above or falls below.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SS. LUBECK, [BETWEEN APIA AND SYDNEY, FEBRUARY] 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - I desire nothing better than to continue my 
relation with the Magazine, to which it pleases me to hear I have 
been useful.  The only thing I have ready is the enclosed barbaric 
piece.  As soon as I have arrived in Sydney I shall send you some 
photographs, a portrait of Tembinoka, perhaps a view of the palace 
or of the 'matted men' at their singing; also T.'s flag, which my 
wife designed for him:  in a word, what I can do best for you.  It 
will be thus a foretaste of my book of travels.  I shall ask you to 
let me have, if I wish it, the use of the plates made, and to make 
up a little tract of the verses and illustrations, of which you 
might send six copies to H. M. Tembinoka, King of Apemama VIA 
Butaritari, Gilbert Islands.  It might be best to send it by 
Crawford and Co., S. F.  There is no postal service; and schooners 
must take it, how they may and when.  Perhaps some such note as 
this might be prefixed:
</p><p>AT MY DEPARTURE FROM THE ISLAND OF APEMAMA, FOR WHICH YOU WILL LOOK 
IN VAIN IN MOST ATLASES, THE KING AND I AGREED, SINCE WE BOTH SET 
UP TO BE IN THE POETICAL WAY, THAT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE OUR 
SEPARATION IN VERSE.  WHETHER OR NOT HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN TRUE TO 
HIS BARGAIN, THE LAGGARD POSTS OF THE PACIFIC MAY PERHAPS INFORM ME 
IN SIX MONTHS, PERHAPS NOT BEFORE A YEAR.  THE FOLLOWING LINES 
REPRESENT MY PART OF THE CONTRACT, AND IT IS HOPED, BY THEIR 
PICTURES OF STRANGE MANNERS, THEY MAY ENTERTAIN A CIVILISED 
AUDIENCE.  NOTHING THROUGHOUT HAS BEEN INVENTED OR EXAGGERATED; THE 
LADY HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE AUTHOR'S MUSE, HAS CONFINED HERSELF 
TO STRINGING INTO RHYME FACTS AND LEGENDS THAT I SAW OR HEARD 
DURING TWO MONTHS' RESIDENCE UPON THE ISLAND.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>You will have received from me a letter about THE WRECKER.  No 
doubt it is a new experiment for me, being disguised so much as a 
study of manners, and the interest turning on a mystery of the 
detective sort, I think there need be no hesitation about beginning 
it in the fall of the year.  Lloyd has nearly finished his part, 
and I shall hope to send you very soon the MS. of about the first 
four-sevenths.  At the same time, I have been employing myself in 
Samoa, collecting facts about the recent war; and I propose to 
write almost at once and to publish shortly a small volume, called 
I know not what - the War In Samoa, the Samoa Trouble, an Island 
War, the War of the Three Consuls, I know not - perhaps you can 
suggest.  It was meant to be a part of my travel book; but material 
has accumulated on my hands until I see myself forced into volume 
form, and I hope it may be of use, if it come soon.  I have a few 
photographs of the war, which will do for illustrations.  It is 
conceivable you might wish to handle this in the Magazine, although 
I am inclined to think you won't, and to agree with you.  But if 
you think otherwise, there it is.  The travel letters (fifty of 
them) are already contracted for in papers; these I was quite bound 
to let M'Clure handle, as the idea was of his suggestion, and I 
always felt a little sore as to one trick I played him in the 
matter of the end-papers.  The war-volume will contain some very 
interesting and picturesque details:  more I can't promise for it.  
Of course the fifty newspaper letters will be simply patches chosen 
from the travel volume (or volumes) as it gets written.
</p><p>But you see I have in hand:-
</p><p>Say half done.  1. THE WRECKER.
</p><p>Lloyd's copy half done, mine not touched.  2. THE PEARL FISHER (a 
novel promised to the LEDGER, and which will form, when it comes in 
book form, No. 2 of our SOUTH SEA YARNS).
</p><p>Not begun, but all material ready.  3. THE WAR VOLUME.
</p><p>Ditto.  4. THE BIG TRAVEL BOOK, which includes the letters.
</p><p>You know how they stand.  5. THE BALLADS.
</p><p>EXCUSEZ DU PEU!  And you see what madness it would be to make any 
fresh engagement.  At the same time, you have THE WRECKER and the 
WAR VOLUME, if you like either - or both - to keep my name in the 
Magazine.
</p><p>It begins to look as if I should not be able to get any more 
ballads done this somewhile.  I know the book would sell better if 
it were all ballads; and yet I am growing half tempted to fill up 
with some other verses.  A good few are connected with my voyage, 
such as the 'Home of Tembinoka' sent herewith, and would have a 
sort of slight affinity to the SOUTH SEA BALLADS.  You might tell 
me how that strikes a stranger.
</p><p>In all this, my real interest is with the travel volume, which 
ought to be of a really extraordinary interest
</p><p>I am sending you 'Tembinoka' as he stands; but there are parts of 
him that I hope to better, particularly in stanzas III. and II.  I 
scarce feel intelligent enough to try just now; and I thought at 
any rate you had better see it, set it up if you think well, and 
let me have a proof; so, at least, we shall get the bulk of it 
straight.  I have spared you Tenkoruti, Tenbaitake, Tembinatake, 
and other barbarous names, because I thought the dentists in the 
States had work enough without my assistance; but my chiefs name is 
TEMBINOKA, pronounced, according to the present quite modern habit 
in the Gilberts, Tembinok'.  Compare in the margin Tengkorootch; a 
singular new trick, setting at defiance all South Sea analogy, for 
nowhere else do they show even the ability, far less the will, to 
end a word upon a consonant.  Loia is Lloyd's name, ship becomes 
shipe, teapot, tipote, etc.  Our admirable friend Herman Melville, 
of whom, since I could judge, I have thought more than ever, had no 
ear for languages whatever:  his Hapar tribe should be Hapaa, etc.
</p><p>But this is of no interest to you:  suffice it, you see how I am as 
usual up to the neck in projects, and really all likely bairns this 
time.  When will this activity cease?  Too soon for me, I dare to 
say.

<p><b>Letter:  TO JAMES PAYN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>FEBRUARY 4TH, 1890, SS. 'LUBECK.'
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - In virtue of confessions in your last, you 
would at the present moment, if you were along of me, be sick; and 
I will ask you to receive that as an excuse for my hand of write.  
Excuse a plain seaman if he regards with scorn the likes of you 
pore land-lubbers ashore now.  (Reference to nautical ditty.)  
Which I may however be allowed to add that when eight months' mail 
was laid by my side one evening in Apia, and my wife and I sat up 
the most of the night to peruse the same - (precious indisposed we 
were next day in consequence) - no letter, out of so many, more 
appealed to our hearts than one from the pore, stick-in-the-mud, 
land-lubbering, common (or garden) Londoner, James Payn.  Thank you 
for it; my wife says, 'Can't I see him when we get back to London?'  
I have told her the thing appeared to me within the spear of 
practical politix.  (Why can't I spell and write like an honest, 
sober, god-fearing litry gent?  I think it's the motion of the 
ship.)  Here I was interrupted to play chess with the chief 
engineer; as I grow old, I prefer the 'athletic sport of cribbage,' 
of which (I am sure I misquote) I have just been reading in your 
delightful LITERARY RECOLLECTIONS.  How you skim along, you and 
Andrew Lang (different as you are), and yet the only two who can 
keep a fellow smiling every page, and ever and again laughing out 
loud.  I joke wi' deeficulty, I believe; I am not funny; and when I 
am, Mrs. Oliphant says I'm vulgar, and somebody else says (in 
Latin) that I'm a whore, which seems harsh and even uncalled for:  
I shall stick to weepers; a 5s. weeper, 2s. 6d. laugher, 1s. 
shocker.
</p><p>My dear sir, I grow more and more idiotic; I cannot even feign 
sanity.  Sometime in the month of June a stalwart weather-beaten 
man, evidently of seafaring antecedents, shall be observed wending 
his way between the Athenaeum Club and Waterloo Place.  Arrived off 
No. 17, he shall be observed to bring his head sharply to the wind, 
and tack into the outer haven.  'Captain Payn in the harbour?' - 
'Ay, ay, sir.  What ship?' - 'Barquentin R. L. S., nine hundred and 
odd days out from the port of Bournemouth, homeward bound, with 
yarns and curiosities.'
</p><p>Who was it said, 'For God's sake, don't speak of it!' about Scott 
and his tears?  He knew what he was saying.  The fear of that hour 
is the skeleton in all our cupboards; that hour when the pastime 
and the livelihood go together; and - I am getting hard of hearing 
myself; a pore young child of forty, but new come frae my Mammy, O!
</p><p>Excuse these follies, and accept the expression of all my regards. 
- Yours affectionately,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

</p><p>UNION CLUB, SYDNEY, MARCH 7TH, 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - I did not send off the enclosed before from 
laziness; having gone quite sick, and being a blooming prisoner 
here in the club, and indeed in my bedroom.  I was in receipt of 
your letters and your ornamental photo, and was delighted to see 
how well you looked, and how reasonably well I stood. . . . I am 
sure I shall never come back home except to die; I may do it, but 
shall always think of the move as suicidal, unless a great change 
comes over me, of which as yet I see no symptom.  This visit to 
Sydney has smashed me handsomely; and yet I made myself a prisoner 
here in the club upon my first arrival.  This is not encouraging 
for further ventures; Sydney winter - or, I might almost say, 
Sydney spring, for I came when the worst was over - is so small an 
affair, comparable to our June depression at home in Scotland. . . 
. The pipe is right again; it was the springs that had rusted, and 
ought to have been oiled.  Its voice is now that of an angel; but, 
Lord! here in the club I dare not wake it!  Conceive my impatience 
to be in my own backwoods and raise the sound of minstrelsy.  What 
pleasures are to be compared with those of the Unvirtuous Virtuoso. 
- Yours ever affectionately, the Unvirtuous Virtuoso,

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SS.  'JANET NICOLL,' OFF UPOLU [SPRING 1890].
</p><p>MY DEAREST COLVIN, - I was sharply ill at Sydney, cut off, right 
out of bed, in this steamer on a fresh island cruise, and have 
already reaped the benefit.  We are excellently found this time, on 
a spacious vessel, with an excellent table; the captain, 
supercargo, our one fellow-passenger, etc., very nice; and the 
charterer, Mr. Henderson, the very man I could have chosen.  The 
truth is, I fear, this life is the only one that suits me; so long 
as I cruise in the South Seas, I shall be well and happy - alas, 
no, I do not mean that, and ABSIT OMEN! - I mean that, so soon as I 
cease from cruising, the nerves are strained, the decline 
commences, and I steer slowly but surely back to bedward.  We left 
Sydney, had a cruel rough passage to Auckland, for the JANET is the 
worst roller I was ever aboard of.  I was confined to my cabin, 
ports closed, self shied out of the berth, stomach (pampered till 
the day I left on a diet of perpetual egg-nogg) revolted at ship's 
food and ship eating, in a frowsy bunk, clinging with one hand to 
the plate, with the other to the glass, and using the knife and 
fork (except at intervals) with the eyelid.  No matter:  I picked 
up hand over hand.  After a day in Auckland, we set sail again; 
were blown up in the main cabin with calcium fires, as we left the 
bay.  Let no man say I am unscientific:  when I ran, on the alert, 
out of my stateroom, and found the main cabin incarnadined with the 
glow of the last scene of a pantomime, I stopped dead:  'What is 
this?' said I.  'This ship is on fire, I see that; but why a 
pantomime?'  And I stood and reasoned the point, until my head was 
so muddled with the fumes that I could not find the companion.  A 
few seconds later, the captain had to enter crawling on his belly, 
and took days to recover (if he has recovered) from the fumes.  By 
singular good fortune, we got the hose down in time and saved the 
ship, but Lloyd lost most of his clothes and a great part of our 
photographs was destroyed.  Fanny saw the native sailors tossing 
overboard a blazing trunk; she stopped them in time, and behold, it 
contained my manuscripts.  Thereafter we had three (or two) days 
fine weather:  then got into a gale of wind, with rain and a 
vexatious sea.  As we drew into our anchorage in a bight of Savage 
Island, a man ashore told me afterwards the sight of the JANET 
NICOLL made him sick; and indeed it was rough play, though nothing 
to the night before.  All through this gale I worked four to six 
hours per diem, spearing the ink-bottle like a flying fish, and 
holding my papers together as I might.  For, of all things, what I 
was at was history - the Samoan business - and I had to turn from 
one to another of these piles of manuscript notes, and from one 
page to another in each, until I should have found employment for 
the hands of Briareus.  All the same, this history is a godsend for 
a voyage; I can put in time, getting events co-ordinated and the 
narrative distributed, when my much-heaving numskull would be 
incapable of finish or fine style.  At Savage we met the missionary 
barque JOHN WILLIAMS.  I tell you it was a great day for Savage 
Island:  the path up the cliffs was crowded with gay islandresses 
(I like that feminine plural) who wrapped me in their embraces, and 
picked my pockets of all my tobacco, with a manner which a touch 
would have made revolting, but as it was, was simply charming, like 
the Golden Age.  One pretty, little, stalwart minx, with a red 
flower behind her ear, had searched me with extraordinary zeal; and 
when, soon after, I missed my matches, I accused her (she still 
following us) of being the thief.  After some delay, and with a 
subtle smile, she produced the box, gave me ONE MATCH, and put the 
rest away again.  Too tired to add more. - Your most affectionate,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>S.S. 'JANET NICOLL,' OFF PERU ISLAND, KINGSMILLS GROUP, JULY 13th, 
'90.
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME, - I am moved to write to you in the matter of 
the end papers.  I am somewhat tempted to begin them again.  Follow 
the reasons PRO and CON:-
</p><p>1st.  I must say I feel as if something in the nature of the end 
paper were a desirable finish to the number, and that the 
substitutes of occasional essays by occasional contributors somehow 
fail to fill the bill.  Should you differ with me on this point, no 
more is to be said.  And what follows must be regarded as lost 
words.
</p><p>2nd.  I am rather taken with the idea of continuing the work.  For 
instance, should you have no distaste for papers of the class 
called RANDOM MEMORIES, I should enjoy continuing them (of course 
at intervals), and when they were done I have an idea they might 
make a readable book.  On the other hand, I believe a greater 
freedom of choice might be taken, the subjects more varied and more 
briefly treated, in somewhat approaching the manner of Andrew Lang 
in the SIGN OF THE SHIP; it being well understood that the broken 
sticks method is one not very suitable (as Colonel Burke would say) 
to my genius, and not very likely to be pushed far in my practice.  
Upon this point I wish you to condense your massive brain.  In the 
last lot I was promised, and I fondly expected to receive, a vast 
amount of assistance from intelligent and genial correspondents.  I 
assure you, I never had a scratch of a pen from any one above the 
level of a village idiot, except once, when a lady sowed my head 
full of grey hairs by announcing that she was going to direct her 
life in future by my counsels.  Will the correspondents be more 
copious and less irrelevant in the future?  Suppose that to be the 
case, will they be of any use to me in my place of exile?  Is it 
possible for a man in Samoa to be in touch with the great heart of 
the People?  And is it not perhaps a mere folly to attempt, from so 
hopeless a distance, anything so delicate as a series of papers?  
Upon these points, perpend, and give me the results of your 
perpensions.
</p><p>3rd.  The emolument would be agreeable to your humble servant.
</p><p>I have now stated all the PROS, and the most of the CONS are come 
in by the way.  There follows, however, one immense Con (with a 
capital 'C'), which I beg you to consider particularly.  I fear 
that, to be of any use for your magazine, these papers should begin 
with the beginning of a volume.  Even supposing my hands were free, 
this would be now impossible for next year.  You have to consider 
whether, supposing you have no other objection, it would be worth 
while to begin the series in the middle of a volume, or desirable 
to delay the whole matter until the beginning of another year.
</p><p>Now supposing that the CONS have it, and you refuse my offer, let 
me make another proposal, which you will be very inclined to refuse 
at the first off-go, but which I really believe might in time come 
to something.  You know how the penny papers have their answers to 
correspondents.  Why not do something of the same kind for the 
'culchawed'?  Why not get men like Stimson, Brownell, Professor 
James, Goldwin Smith, and others who will occur to you more readily 
than to me, to put and to answer a series of questions of 
intellectual and general interest, until at last you should have 
established a certain standard of matter to be discussed in this 
part of the Magazine?
</p><p>I want you to get me bound volumes of the Magazine from its start.  
The Lord knows I have had enough copies; where they are I know not.  
A wandering author gathers no magazines.
</p><p>THE WRECKER is in no forrader state than in last reports.  I have 
indeed got to a period when I cannot well go on until I can refresh 
myself on the proofs of the beginning.  My respected collaborator, 
who handles the machine which is now addressing you, has indeed 
carried his labours farther, but not, I am led to understand, with 
what we used to call a blessing; at least, I have been refused a 
sight of his latest labours.  However, there is plenty of time 
ahead, and I feel no anxiety about the tale, except that it may 
meet with your approval.
</p><p>All this voyage I have been busy over my TRAVELS, which, given a 
very high temperature and the saloon of a steamer usually going 
before the wind, and with the cabins in front of the engines, has 
come very near to prostrating me altogether.  You will therefore 
understand that there are no more poems.  I wonder whether there 
are already enough, and whether you think that such a volume would 
be worth the publishing?  I shall hope to find in Sydney some 
expression of your opinion on this point.  Living as I do among - 
not the most cultured of mankind ('splendidly educated and perfect 
gentlemen when sober') - I attach a growing importance to friendly 
criticisms from yourself.
</p><p>I believe that this is the most of our business.  As for my health, 
I got over my cold in a fine style, but have not been very well of 
late.  To my unaffected annoyance, the blood-spitting has started 
again.  I find the heat of a steamer decidedly wearing and trying 
in these latitudes, and I am inclined to think the superior 
expedition rather dearly paid for.  Still, the fact that one does 
not even remark the coming of a squall, nor feel relief on its 
departure, is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude.  
The rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well; both seem less 
run down than they were on the EQUATOR, and Mrs. Stevenson very 
much less so.  We have now been three months away, have visited 
about thirty-five islands, many of which were novel to us, and some 
extremely entertaining; some also were old acquaintances, and 
pleasant to revisit.  In the meantime, we have really a capital 
time aboard ship, in the most pleasant and interesting society, and 
with (considering the length and nature of the voyage) an excellent 
table.  Please remember us all to Mr. Scribner, the young chieftain 
of the house, and the lady, whose health I trust is better.  To 
Mrs. Burlingame we all desire to be remembered, and I hope you will 
give our news to Low, St. Gaudens, Faxon, and others of the 
faithful in the city.  I shall probably return to Samoa direct, 
having given up all idea of returning to civilisation in the 
meanwhile.  There, on my ancestral acres, which I purchased six 
months ago from a blind Scots blacksmith, you will please address 
me until further notice.  The name of the ancestral acres is going 
to be Vailima; but as at the present moment nobody else knows the 
name, except myself and the co-patentees, it will be safer, if less 
ambitious, to address R. L. S., Apia, Samoa.  The ancestral acres 
run to upwards of three hundred; they enjoy the ministrations of 
five streams, whence the name.  They are all at the present moment 
under a trackless covering of magnificent forest, which would be 
worth a great deal if it grew beside a railway terminus.  To me, as 
it stands, it represents a handsome deficit.  Obliging natives from 
the Cannibal Islands are now cutting it down at my expense.  You 
would be able to run your magazine to much greater advantage if the 
terms of authors were on the same scale with those of my cannibals.  
We have also a house about the size of a manufacturer's lodge.  
'Tis but the egg of the future palace, over the details of which on 
paper Mrs. Stevenson and I have already shed real tears; what it 
will be when it comes to paying for it, I leave you to imagine.  
But if it can only be built as now intended, it will be with 
genuine satisfaction and a growunded pride that I shall welcome you 
at the steps of my Old Colonial Home, when you land from the 
steamer on a long-merited holiday.  I speak much at my ease; yet I 
do not know, I may be now an outlaw, a bankrupt, the abhorred of 
all good men.  I do not know, you probably do.  Has Hyde turned 
upon me?  Have I fallen, like Danvers Carew?
</p><p>It is suggested to me that you might like to know what will be my 
future society.  Three consuls, all at logger-heads with one 
another, or at the best in a clique of two against one; three 
different sects of missionaries, not upon the best of terms; and 
the Catholics and Protestants in a condition of unhealable ill-
feeling as to whether a wooden drum ought or ought not to be beaten 
to announce the time of school.  The native population, very 
genteel, very songful, very agreeable, very good-looking, 
chronically spoiling for a fight (a circumstance not to be entirely 
neglected in the design of the palace).  As for the white 
population of (technically, 'The Beach'), I don't suppose it is 
possible for any person not thoroughly conversant with the South 
Seas to form the smallest conception of such a society, with its 
grog-shops, its apparently unemployed hangers-on, its merchants of 
all degrees of respectability and the reverse.  The paper, of which 
I must really send you a copy - if yours were really a live 
magazine, you would have an exchange with the editor:  I assure 
you, it has of late contained a great deal of matter about one of 
your contributors - rejoices in the name of SAMOA TIMES AND SOUTH 
SEA ADVERTISER.  The advertisements in the ADVERTISER are 
permanent, being simply subsidies for its existence.  A dashing 
warfare of newspaper correspondence goes on between the various 
residents, who are rather fond of recurring to one another's 
antecedents.  But when all is said, there are a lot of very nice, 
pleasant people, and I don't know that Apia is very much worse than 
half a hundred towns that I could name.

<p><b>Letter:  TO CHARLES BAXTER</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>HOTEL SEBASTOPOL, NOUMEA, AUGUST 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - I have stayed here a week while Lloyd and my 
wife continue to voyage in the JANET NICOLL; this I did, partly to 
see the convict system, partly to shorten my stay in the extreme 
cold - hear me with my extreme! MOI QUI SUIS ORIGINAIRE D'EDINBOURG 
- of Sydney at this season.  I am feeling very seedy, utterly 
fatigued, and overborne with sleep.  I have a fine old gentleman of 
a doctor, who attends and cheers and entertains, if he does not 
cure me; but even with his ministrations I am almost incapable of 
the exertion sufficient for this letter; and I am really, as I 
write, falling down with sleep.  What is necessary to say, I must 
try to say shortly.  Lloyd goes to clear out our establishments:  
pray keep him in funds, if I have any; if I have not, pray try to 
raise them.  Here is the idea:  to install ourselves, at the risk 
of bankruptcy, in Samoa.  It is not the least likely it will pay 
(although it may); but it is almost certain it will support life, 
with very few external expenses.  If I die, it will be an endowment 
for the survivors, at least for my wife and Lloyd; and my mother, 
who might prefer to go home, has her own.  Hence I believe I shall 
do well to hurry my installation.  The letters are already in part 
done; in part done is a novel for Scribner; in the course of the 
next twelve months I should receive a considerable amount of money.  
I am aware I had intended to pay back to my capital some of this.  
I am now of opinion I should act foolishly.  Better to build the 
house and have a roof and farm of my own; and thereafter, with a 
livelihood assured, save and repay . . .  There is my livelihood, 
all but books and wine, ready in a nutshell; and it ought to be 
more easy to save and to repay afterwards.  Excellent, say you, but 
will you save and will you repay?  I do not know, said the Bell of 
Old Bow. . . . It seems clear to me. . . . The deuce of the affair 
is that I do not know when I shall see you and Colvin.  I guess you 
will have to come and see me:  many a time already we have arranged 
the details of your visit in the yet unbuilt house on the mountain.  
I shall be able to get decent wine from Noumea.  We shall be able 
to give you a decent welcome, and talk of old days.  APROPOS of old 
days, do you remember still the phrase we heard in Waterloo Place?  
I believe you made a piece for the piano on that phrase.  Pray, if 
you remember it, send it me in your next.  If you find it 
impossible to write correctly, send it me A LA RECITATIVE, and 
indicate the accents.  Do you feel (you must) how strangely heavy 
and stupid I am?  I must at last give up and go sleep; I am simply 
a rag.
</p><p>The morrow:  I feel better, but still dim and groggy.  To-night I 
go to the governor's; such a lark - no dress clothes - twenty-four 
hours' notice - able-bodied Polish tailor - suit made for a man 
with the figure of a puncheon - same hastily altered for self with 
the figure of a bodkin - sight inconceivable.  Never mind; dress 
clothes, 'which nobody can deny'; and the officials have been all 
so civil that I liked neither to refuse nor to appear in mufti.  
Bad dress clothes only prove you are a grisly ass; no dress 
clothes, even when explained, indicate a want of respect.  I wish 
you were here with me to help me dress in this wild raiment, and to 
accompany me to M. Noel-Pardon's.  I cannot say what I would give 
if there came a knock now at the door and you came in.  I guess 
Noel-Pardon would go begging, and we might burn the fr. 200 dress 
clothes in the back garden for a bonfire; or what would be yet more 
expensive and more humorous, get them once more expanded to fit 
you, and when that was done, a second time cut down for my gossamer 
dimensions.
</p><p>I hope you never forget to remember me to your father, who has 
always a place in my heart, as I hope I have a little in his.  His 
kindness helped me infinitely when you and I were young; I recall 
it with gratitude and affection in this town of convicts at the 
world's end.  There are very few things, my dear Charles, worth 
mention:  on a retrospect of life, the day's flash and colour, one 
day with another, flames, dazzles, and puts to sleep; and when the 
days are gone, like a fast-flying thaumatrope, they make but a 
single pattern.  Only a few things stand out; and among these - 
most plainly to me - Rutland Square, - Ever, my dear Charles, your 
affectionate friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - Just returned from trying on the dress clo'.  Lord, you 
should see the coat!  It stands out at the waist like a bustle, the 
flaps cross in front, the sleeves are like bags.

</p><p>UNION CLUB, SYDNEY [AUGUST 1890].
</p><p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME
</p><p>BALLADS.
</p><p>The deuce is in this volume.  It has cost me more botheration and 
dubiety than any other I ever took in hand.  On one thing my mind 
is made up:  the verses at the end have no business there, and 
throw them down.  Many of them are bad, many of the rest want nine 
years' keeping, and the remainder are not relevant - throw them 
down; some I never want to hear of more, others will grow in time 
towards decent items in a second UNDERWOODS - and in the meanwhile, 
down with them!  At the same time, I have a sneaking idea the 
ballads are not altogether without merit - I don't know if they're 
poetry, but they're good narrative, or I'm deceived.  (You've never 
said one word about them, from which I astutely gather you are dead 
set against:  'he was a diplomatic man' - extract from epitaph of 
E. L. B. - 'and remained on good terms with Minor Poets.')  You 
will have to judge:  one of the Gladstonian trinity of paths must 
be chosen.  (1st) Either publish the five ballads, such as they 
are, in a volume called BALLADS; in which case pray send sheets at 
once to Chatto and Windus.  Or (2nd) write and tell me you think 
the book too small, and I'll try and get into the mood to do some 
more.  Or (3rd) write and tell me the whole thing is a blooming 
illusion; in which case draw off some twenty copies for my private 
entertainment, and charge me with the expense of the whole dream.
</p><p>In the matter of rhyme no man can judge himself; I am at the 
world's end, have no one to consult, and my publisher holds his 
tongue.  I call it unfair and almost unmanly.  I do indeed begin to 
be filled with animosity; Lord, wait till you see the continuation 
of THE WRECKER, when I introduce some New York publishers. . . It's 
a good scene; the quantities you drink and the really hideous 
language you are represented as employing may perhaps cause you one 
tithe of the pain you have inflicted by your silence on, sir, The 
Poetaster,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>Lloyd is off home; my wife and I dwell sundered:  she in lodgings, 
preparing for the move; I here in the club, and at my old trade - 
bedridden.  Naturally, the visit home is given up; we only wait our 
opportunity to get to Samoa, where, please, address me.
</p><p>Have I yet asked you to despatch the books and papers left in your

HUMAINE I had already perused in Noumea, listening the while to the 
strains of the convict band.  He a Beast; but not human, and, to be 
frank, not very interesting.  'Nervous maladies:  the homicidal 
ward,' would be the better name:  O, this game gets very tedious.
</p><p>Your two long and kind letters have helped to entertain the old 
familiar sickbed.  So has a book called THE BONDMAN, by Hall Caine; 
I wish you would look at it.  I am not half-way through yet.  Read 
the book, and communicate your views.  Hall Caine, by the way, 
appears to take Hugo's view of History and Chronology.  (LATER; the 
book doesn't keep up; it gets very wild.)
</p><p>I must tell you plainly - I can't tell Colvin - I do not think I 
shall come to England more than once, and then it'll be to die.  
Health I enjoy in the tropics; even here, which they call sub- or 
semi-tropical, I come only to catch cold.  I have not been out 
since my arrival; live here in a nice bedroom by the fireside, and 
read books and letters from Henry James, and send out to get his 
TRAGIC MUSE, only to be told they can't be had as yet in Sydney, 
and have altogether a placid time.  But I can't go out!  The 
thermometer was nearly down to 50 degrees the other day - no 
temperature for me, Mr. James:  how should I do in England?  I fear 
not at all.  Am I very sorry?  I am sorry about seven or eight 
people in England, and one or two in the States.  And outside of 
that, I simply prefer Samoa.  These are the words of honesty and 
soberness.  (I am fasting from all but sin, coughing, THE BONDMAN, 
a couple of eggs and a cup of tea.)  I was never fond of towns, 
houses, society, or (it seems) civilisation.  Nor yet it seems was 
I ever very fond of (what is technically called) God's green earth.  
The sea, islands, the islanders, the island life and climate, make 
and keep me truly happier.  These last two years I have been much 
at sea, and I have NEVER WEARIED; sometimes I have indeed grown 
impatient for some destination; more often I was sorry that the 
voyage drew so early to an end; and never once did I lose my 
fidelity to blue water and a ship.  It is plain, then, that for me 
my exile to the place of schooners and islands can be in no sense 
regarded as a calamity.
</p><p>Good-bye just now:  I must take a turn at my proofs.
</p><p>N.B. - Even my wife has weakened about the sea.  She wearied, the 
last time we were ashore, to get afloat again. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MARCEL SCHWOB</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>UNION CLUB, SYDNEY, AUGUST 19TH, 1890.
</p><p>MY DEAR MR. SCHWOB, - MAIS, ALORS, VOUS AVEZ TOUS LES BONHEURS, 
VOUS!  More about Villon; it seems incredible:  when it is put in 
order, pray send it me.
</p><p>You wish to translate the BLACK ARROW:  dear sir, you are hereby 
authorised; but I warn you, I do not like the work.  Ah, if you, 
who know so well both tongues, and have taste and instruction - if 
you would but take a fancy to translate a book of mine that I 
myself admired - for we sometimes admire our own - or I do - with 
what satisfaction would the authority be granted!  But these things 
are too much to expect.  VOUS NE DETESTEZ PAS ALORS MES BONNES 
FEMMES? MOI, JE LES DETESTE.  I have never pleased myself with any 
women of mine save two character parts, one of only a few lines - 
the Countess of Rosen, and Madame Desprez in the TREASURE OF 
FRANCHARD.
</p><p>I had indeed one moment of pride about my poor BLACK ARROW:  Dickon 
Crookback I did, and I do, think is a spirited and possible figure.  
Shakespeare's - O, if we can call that cocoon Shakespeare! - 
Shakespeare's is spirited - one likes to see the untaught athlete 
butting against the adamantine ramparts of human nature, head down, 
breach up; it reminds us how trivial we are to-day, and what safety 
resides in our triviality.  For spirited it may be, but O, sure not 
possible!  I love Dumas and I love Shakespeare:  you will not 
mistake me when I say that the Richard of the one reminds me of the 
Porthos of the other; and if by any sacrifice of my own literary 
baggage I could clear the VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE of Porthos, JEKYLL 
might go, and the MASTER, and the BLACK ARROW, you may be sure, and 
I should think my life not lost for mankind if half a dozen more of 
my volumes must be thrown in.
</p><p>The tone of your pleasant letters makes me egotistical; you make me 
take myself too gravely.  Comprehend how I have lived much of my 
time in France, and loved your country, and many of its people, and 
all the time was learning that which your country has to teach - 
breathing in rather that atmosphere of art which can only there be 
breathed; and all the time knew - and raged to know - that I might 
write with the pen of angels or of heroes, and no Frenchman be the 
least the wiser!  And now steps in M. Marcel Schwob, writes me the 
most kind encouragement, and reads and understands, and is kind 
enough to like my work.
</p><p>I am just now overloaded with work.  I have two huge novels on hand 
- THE WRECKER and the PEARL FISHER, in collaboration with my 
stepson:  the latter, the PEARL FISHER, I think highly of, for a 
black, ugly, trampling, violent story, full of strange scenes and 
striking characters.  And then I am about waist-deep in my big book 
on the South Seas:  THE big book on the South Seas it ought to be, 
and shall.  And besides, I have some verses in the press, which, 
however, I hesitate to publish.  For I am no judge of my own verse; 
self-deception is there so facile.  All this and the cares of an 
impending settlement in Samoa keep me very busy, and a cold (as 
usual) keeps me in bed.
</p><p>Alas, I shall not have the pleasure to see you yet awhile, if ever.  
You must be content to take me as a wandering voice, and in the 
form of occasional letters from recondite islands; and address me, 
if you will be good enough to write, to Apia, Samoa.  My stepson, 
Mr. Osbourne, goes home meanwhile to arrange some affairs; it is 
not unlikely he may go to Paris to arrange about the illustrations 
to my South Seas; in which case I shall ask him to call upon you, 
and give you some word of our outlandish destinies.  You will find 
him intelligent, I think; and I am sure, if (PAR HASARD) you should 
take any interest in the islands, he will have much to tell you. - 
Herewith I conclude, and am your obliged and interested 
correspondent,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - The story you refer to has got lost in the post.

<p><b>Letter:  TO ANDREW LANG</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>UNION CLUB, SYDNEY [AUGUST 1890].
</p><p>MY DEAR LANG, - I observed with a great deal of surprise and 
interest that a controversy in which you have been taking sides at 
home, in yellow London, hinges in part at least on the Gilbert 
Islanders and their customs in burial.  Nearly six months of my 
life has been passed in the group:  I have revisited it but the 
other day; and I make haste to tell you what I know.  The upright 
stones - I enclose you a photograph of one on Apemama - are 
certainly connected with religion; I do not think they are adored.  
They stand usually on the windward shore of the islands, that is to 
say, apart from habitation (on ENCLOSED ISLANDS, where the people 
live on the sea side, I do not know how it is, never having lived 
on one).  I gathered from Tembinoka, Rex Apemamae, that the pillars 
were supposed to fortify the island from invasion:  spiritual 
martellos.  I think he indicated they were connected with the cult 
of Tenti - pronounce almost as chintz in English, the T being 
explosive; but you must take this with a grain of salt, for I knew 
no word of Gilbert Island; and the King's English, although 
creditable, is rather vigorous than exact.  Now, here follows the 
point of interest to you:  such pillars, or standing stones, have 
no connection with graves.  The most elaborate grave that I have 
ever seen in the group - to be certain - is in the form of a RAISED 
BORDER of gravel, usually strewn with broken glass.  One, of which 
I cannot be sure that it was a grave, for I was told by one that it 
was, and by another that it was not - consisted of a mound about 
breast high in an excavated taro swamp, on the top of which was a 
child's house, or rather MANIAPA - that is to say, shed, or open 
house, such as is used in the group for social or political 
gatherings - so small that only a child could creep under its 
eaves.  I have heard of another great tomb on Apemama, which I did 
not see; but here again, by all accounts, no sign of a standing 
stone.  My report would be - no connection between standing stones 
and sepulture.  I shall, however, send on the terms of the problem 
to a highly intelligent resident trader, who knows more than 
perhaps any one living, white or native, of the Gilbert group; and 
you shall have the result.  In Samoa, whither I return for good, I 
shall myself make inquiries; up to now, I have neither seen nor 
heard of any standing stones in that group. - Yours,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. CHARLES FAIRCHILD</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>UNION CLUB, SYDNEY [SEPTEMBER 1890].
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD, - I began a letter to you on board the 
JANET NICOLL on my last cruise, wrote, I believe, two sheets, and 
ruthlessly destroyed the flippant trash.  Your last has given me 
great pleasure and some pain, for it increased the consciousness of 
my neglect.  Now, this must go to you, whatever it is like.
</p><p>. . . You are quite right; our civilisation is a hollow fraud, all 
the fun of life is lost by it; all it gains is that a larger number 
of persons can continue to be contemporaneously unhappy on the 
surface of the globe.  O, unhappy! - there is a big word and a 
false - continue to be not nearly - by about twenty per cent. - so 
happy as they might be:  that would be nearer the mark.
</p><p>When - observe that word, which I will write again and larger - 
WHEN you come to see us in Samoa, you will see for yourself a 
healthy and happy people.
</p><p>You see, you are one of the very few of our friends rich enough to 
come and see us; and when my house is built, and the road is made, 
and we have enough fruit planted and poultry and pigs raised, it is 
undeniable that you must come - must is the word; that is the way 
in which I speak to ladies.  You and Fairchild, anyway - perhaps my 
friend Blair - we'll arrange details in good time.  It will be the 
salvation of your souls, and make you willing to die.
</p><p>Let me tell you this:  In '74 or 5 there came to stay with my 
father and mother a certain Mr. Seed, a prime minister or something 
of New Zealand.  He spotted what my complaint was; told me that I 
had no business to stay in Europe; that I should find all I cared 
for, and all that was good for me, in the Navigator Islands; sat up 
till four in the morning persuading me, demolishing my scruples.  
And I resisted:  I refused to go so far from my father and mother.  
O, it was virtuous, and O, wasn't it silly!  But my father, who was 
always my dearest, got to his grave without that pang; and now in 
1890, I (or what is left of me) go at last to the Navigator 
Islands.  God go with us!  It is but a Pisgah sight when all is 
said; I go there only to grow old and die; but when you come, you 
will see it is a fair place for the purpose.
</p><p>Flaubert has not turned up; I hope he will soon; I knew of him only 
through Maxime Descamps. - With kindest messages to yourself and 
all of yours, I remain,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
