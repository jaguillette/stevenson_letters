<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. DE MATTOS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], JANUARY 1ST, 1886.
</p><p>DEAREST KATHARINE, - Here, on a very little book and accompanied 
with lame verses, I have put your name.  Our kindness is now 
getting well on in years; it must be nearly of age; and it gets 
more valuable to me with every time I see you.  It is not possible 
to express any sentiment, and it is not necessary to try, at least 
between us.  You know very well that I love you dearly, and that I 
always will.  I only wish the verses were better, but at least you 
like the story; and it is sent to you by the one that loves you - 
Jekyll, and not Hyde.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>AVE!
</p><p>Bells upon the city are ringing in the night;
High above the gardens are the houses full of light;
On the heathy Pentlands is the curlew flying free;
And the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie.
</p><p>We cannae break the bonds that God decreed to bind,
Still we'll be the children of the heather and the wind;
Far away from home, O, it's still for you and me
That the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie!
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], 1ST, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR KINNICUM, - I am a very bad dog, but not for the first 
time.  Your book, which is very interesting, came duly; and I 
immediately got a very bad cold indeed, and have been fit for 
nothing whatever.  I am a bit better now, and aye on the mend; so I 
write to tell you, I thought of you on New Year's Day; though, I 
own, it would have been more decent if I had thought in time for 
you to get my letter then.  Well, what can't be cured must be 
endured, Mr. Lawrie; and you must be content with what I give.  If 
I wrote all the letters I ought to write, and at the proper time, I 
should be very good and very happy; but I doubt if I should do 
anything else.
</p><p>I suppose you will be in town for the New Year; and I hope your 
health is pretty good.  What you want is diet; but it is as much 
use to tell you that as it is to tell my father.  And I quite admit 
a diet is a beastly thing.  I doubt, however, if it be as bad as 
not being allowed to speak, which I have tried fully, and do not 
like.  When, at the same time, I was not allowed to read, it passed 
a joke.  But these are troubles of the past, and on this day, at 
least, it is proper to suppose they won't return.  But we are not 
put here to enjoy ourselves:  it was not God's purpose; and I am 
prepared to argue, it is not our sincere wish.  As for our deserts, 
the less said of them the better, for somebody might hear, and 
nobody cares to be laughed at.  A good man is a very noble thing to 
see, but not to himself; what he seems to God is, fortunately, not 
our business; that is the domain of faith; and whether on the first 
of January or the thirty-first of December, faith is a good word to 
end on.
</p><p>My dear Cummy, many happy returns to you and my best love. - The 
worst correspondent in the world,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>

<p><b>Letter:  TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], JANUARY 1ST, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - Many happy returns of the day to you all; I am 
fairly well and in good spirits; and much and hopefully occupied 
with dear Jenkin's life.  The inquiry in every detail, every letter 
that I read, makes me think of him more nobly.  I cannot imagine 
how I got his friendship; I did not deserve it.  I believe the 
notice will be interesting and useful.
</p><p>My father's last letter, owing to the use of a quill pen and the 
neglect of blotting-paper, was hopelessly illegible.  Every one 
tried, and every one failed to decipher an important word on which 
the interest of one whole clause (and the letter consisted of two) 
depended.
</p><p>I find I can make little more of this; but I'll spare the blots. - 
Dear people, ever your loving son,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>I will try again, being a giant refreshed by the house being empty.  
The presence of people is the great obstacle to letter-writing.  I 
deny that letters should contain news (I mean mine; those of other 
people should).  But mine should contain appropriate sentiments and 
humorous nonsense, or nonsense without the humour.  When the house 
is empty, the mind is seized with a desire - no, that is too strong 
- a willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot, which constitutes 
(in me) the true spirit of correspondence.  When I have no remarks 
to offer (and nobody to offer them to), my pen flies, and you see 
the remarkable consequence of a page literally covered with words 
and genuinely devoid of sense.  I can always do that, if quite 
alone, and I like doing it; but I have yet to learn that it is 
beloved by correspondents.  The deuce of it is, that there is no 
end possible but the end of the paper; and as there is very little 
left of that - if I cannot stop writing - suppose you give up 
reading.  It would all come to the same thing; and I think we 
should all be happier...

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], JAN. 2ND, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - LAMIA has come, and I do not know how to thank you, 
not only for the beautiful art of the designs, but for the handsome 
and apt words of the dedication.  My favourite is 'Bathes unseen,' 
which is a masterpiece; and the next, 'Into the green recessed 
woods,' is perhaps more remarkable, though it does not take my 
fancy so imperiously.  The night scene at Corinth pleases me also.  
The second part offers fewer opportunities.  I own I should like to 
see both ISABELLA and the EVE thus illustrated; and then there's 
HYPERION - O, yes, and ENDYMION!  I should like to see the lot:  
beautiful pictures dance before me by hundreds:  I believe ENDYMION 
would suit you best.  It also is in faery-land; and I see a hundred 
opportunities, cloudy and flowery glories, things as delicate as 
the cobweb in the bush; actions, not in themselves of any mighty 
purport, but made for the pencil:  the feast of Pan, Peona's isle, 
the 'slabbed margin of a well,' the chase of the butterfly, the 
nymph, Glaucus, Cybele, Sleep on his couch, a farrago of 
unconnected beauties.  But I divagate; and all this sits in the 
bosom of the publisher.
</p><p>What is more important, I accept the terms of the dedication with a 
frank heart, and the terms of your Latin legend fairly.  The sight 
of your pictures has once more awakened me to my right mind; 
something may come of it; yet one more bold push to get free of 
this prisonyard of the abominably ugly, where I take my daily 
exercise with my contemporaries.  I do not know, I have a feeling 
in my bones, a sentiment which may take on the forms of 
imagination, or may not.  If it does, I shall owe it to you; and 
the thing will thus descend from Keats even if on the wrong side of 
the blanket.  If it can be done in prose - that is the puzzle - I 
divagate again.  Thank you again:  you can draw and yet you do not 
love the ugly:  what are you doing in this age?  Flee, while it is 
yet time; they will have your four limbs pinned upon a stable door 
to scare witches.  The ugly, my unhappy friend, is DE RIGUEUR:  it 
is the only wear!  What a chance you threw away with the serpent!  
Why had Apollonius no pimples?  Heavens, my dear Low, you do not 
know your business....
</p><p>I send you herewith a Gothic gnome for your Greek nymph; but the 
gnome is interesting, I think, and he came out of a deep mine, 
where he guards the fountain of tears.  It is not always the time 
to rejoice. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>The gnome's name is JEKYLL &amp; HYDE; I believe you will find he is 
likewise quite willing to answer to the name of Low or Stevenson.
</p><p>SAME DAY. - I have copied out on the other sheet some bad verses, 
which somehow your picture suggested; as a kind of image of things 
that I pursue and cannot reach, and that you seem - no, not to have 
reached - but to have come a thought nearer to than I.  This is the 
life we have chosen:  well, the choice was mad, but I should make 
it again.
</p><p>What occurs to me is this:  perhaps they might be printed in (say) 
the CENTURY for the sake of my name; and if that were possible, 
they might advertise your book.  It might be headed as sent in 
acknowledgment of your LAMIA.  Or perhaps it might be introduced by 
the phrases I have marked above.  I dare say they would stick it 
in:  I want no payment, being well paid by LAMIA.  If they are not, 
keep them to yourself.
</p><p><br />
TO WILL H. LOW
</p><p><br />
DAMNED BAD LINES IN RETURN FOR A BEAUTIFUL BOOK
</p><p>Youth now flees on feathered foot.
Faint and fainter sounds the flute;
Rarer songs of Gods.
And still,
Somewhere on the sunny hill,
Or along the winding stream,
Through the willows, flits a dream;
Flits, but shows a smiling face,
Flees, but with so quaint a grace,
None can choose to stay at home,
All must follow - all must roam.
This is unborn beauty:  she
Now in air floats high and free,
Takes the sun, and breaks the blue; -
Late, with stooping pinion flew
Raking hedgerow trees, and wet
Her wing in silver streams, and set
Shining foot on temple roof.
Now again she flies aloof,
Coasting mountain clouds, and kissed
By the evening's amethyst.
In wet wood and miry lane
Still we pound and pant in vain;
Still with earthy foot we chase
Waning pinion, fainting face;
Still, with grey hair, we stumble on
Till - behold! - the vision gone!
Where has fleeting beauty led?
To the doorway of the dead!
qy. omit? [Life is gone, but life was gay:
We have come the primrose way!]

<p><b>Letter:  TO EDMUND GOSSE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JAN. 2ND, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR GOSSE, - Thank you for your letter, so interesting to my 
vanity.  There is a review in the St. James's, which, as it seems 
to hold somewhat of your opinions, and is besides written with a 
pen and not a poker, we think may possibly be yours.  The PRINCE 
has done fairly well in spite of the reviews, which have been bad:  
he was, as you doubtless saw, well slated in the SATURDAY; one 
paper received it as a child's story; another (picture my agony) 
described it as a 'Gilbert comedy.'  It was amusing to see the race 
between me and Justin M'Carthy:  the Milesian has won by a length.
</p><p>That is the hard part of literature.  You aim high, and you take 
longer over your work, and it will not be so successful as if you 
had aimed low and rushed it.  What the public likes is work (of any 
kind) a little loosely executed; so long as it is a little wordy, a 
little slack, a little dim and knotless, the dear public likes it; 
it should (if possible) be a little dull into the bargain.  I know 
that good work sometimes hits; but, with my hand on my heart, I 
think it is by an accident.  And I know also that good work must 
succeed at last; but that is not the doing of the public; they are 
only shamed into silence or affectation.  I do not write for the 
public; I do write for money, a nobler deity; and most of all for 
myself, not perhaps any more noble, but both more intelligent and 
nearer home.
</p><p>Let us tell each other sad stories of the bestiality of the beast 
whom we feed.  What he likes is the newspaper; and to me the press 
is the mouth of a sewer, where lying is professed as from an 
university chair, and everything prurient, and ignoble, and 
essentially dull, finds its abode and pulpit.  I do not like 
mankind; but men, and not all of these - and fewer women.  As for 
respecting the race, and, above all, that fatuous rabble of 
burgesses called 'the public,' God save me from such irreligion! - 
that way lies disgrace and dishonour.  There must be something 
wrong in me, or I would not be popular.
</p><p>This is perhaps a trifle stronger than my sedate and permanent 
opinion.  Not much, I think.  As for the art that we practise, I 
have never been able to see why its professors should be respected.  
They chose the primrose path; when they found it was not all 
primroses, but some of it brambly, and much of it uphill, they 
began to think and to speak of themselves as holy martyrs.  But a 
man is never martyred in any honest sense in the pursuit of his 
pleasure; and DELIRIUM TREMENS has more of the honour of the cross.  
We were full of the pride of life, and chose, like prostitutes, to 
live by a pleasure.  We should be paid if we give the pleasure we 
pretend to give; but why should we be honoured?
</p><p>I hope some day you and Mrs. Gosse will come for a Sunday; but we 
must wait till I am able to see people.  I am very full of Jenkin's 
life; it is painful, yet very pleasant, to dig into the past of a 
dead friend, and find him, at every spadeful, shine brighter.  I 
own, as I read, I wonder more and more why he should have taken me 
to be a friend.  He had many and obvious faults upon the face of 
him; the heart was pure gold.  I feel it little pain to have lost 
him, for it is a loss in which I cannot believe; I take it, against 
reason, for an absence; if not to-day, then to-morrow, I still 
fancy I shall see him in the door; and then, now when I know him 
better, how glad a meeting!  Yes, if I could believe in the 
immortality business, the world would indeed be too good to be 
true; but we were put here to do what service we can, for honour 
and not for hire:  the sods cover us, and the worm that never dies, 
the conscience, sleeps well at last; these are the wages, besides 
what we receive so lavishly day by day; and they are enough for a 
man who knows his own frailty and sees all things in the proportion 
of reality.  The soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of 
reward.  Nor is happiness, whether eternal or temporal, the reward 
that mankind seeks.  Happinesses are but his wayside campings; his 
soul is in the journey; he was born for the struggle, and only 
tastes his life in effort and on the condition that he is opposed.  
How, then, is such a creature, so fiery, so pugnacious, so made up 
of discontent and aspiration, and such noble and uneasy passions - 
how can he be rewarded but by rest?  I would not say it aloud; for 
man's cherished belief is that he loves that happiness which he 
continually spurns and passes by; and this belief in some ulterior 
happiness exactly fits him.  He does not require to stop and taste 
it; he can be about the rugged and bitter business where his heart 
lies; and yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal 
tea-party, and enjoy the notion that he is both himself and 
something else; and that his friends will yet meet him, all ironed 
out and emasculate, and still be lovable, - as if love did not live 
in the faults of the beloved only, and draw its breath in an 
unbroken round of forgiveness!  But the truth is, we must fight 
until we die; and when we die there can be no quiet for mankind but 
complete resumption into - what? - God, let us say - when all these 
desperate tricks will lie spellbound at last.
</p><p>Here came my dinner and cut this sermon short - EXCUSEZ.

</p><p>DEAR JAMES PAYN, - Your very kind letter came very welcome; and 
still more welcome the news that you see -'s tale.  I will now tell 
you (and it was very good and very wise of me not to tell it 
before) that he is one of the most unlucky men I know, having put 
all his money into a pharmacy at Hyeres, when the cholera 
(certainly not his fault) swept away his customers in a body.  Thus 
you can imagine the pleasure I have to announce to him a spark of 
hope, for he sits to-day in his pharmacy, doing nothing and taking 
nothing, and watching his debts inexorably mount up.
</p><p>To pass to other matters:  your hand, you are perhaps aware, is not 
one of those that can be read running; and the name of your 
daughter remains for me undecipherable.  I call her, then, your 
daughter - and a very good name too - and I beg to explain how it 
came about that I took her house.  The hospital was a point in my 
tale; but there is a house on each side.  Now the true house is the 
one before the hospital:  is that No. 11?  If not, what do you 
complain of?  If it is, how can I help what is true?  Everything in 
the DYNAMITER is not true; but the story of the Brown Box is, in 
almost every particular; I lay my hand on my heart and swear to it.  
It took place in that house in 1884; and if your daughter was in 
that house at the time, all I can say is she must have kept very 
bad society.
</p><p>But I see you coming.  Perhaps your daughter's house has not a 
balcony at the back?  I cannot answer for that; I only know that 
side of Queen Square from the pavement and the back windows of 
Brunswick Row.  Thence I saw plenty of balconies (terraces rather); 
and if there is none to the particular house in question, it must 
have been so arranged to spite me.
</p><p>I now come to the conclusion of this matter.  I address three 
questions to your daughter:-
</p><p>1st Has her house the proper terrace?
</p><p>2nd.  Is it on the proper side of the hospital?
</p><p>3rd.  Was she there in the summer of 1884?
</p><p>You see, I begin to fear that Mrs. Desborough may have deceived me 
on some trifling points, for she is not a lady of peddling 
exactitude.  If this should prove to be so, I will give your 
daughter a proper certificate, and her house property will return 
to its original value.
</p><p>Can man say more? - Yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>I saw the other day that the Eternal had plagiarised from LOST SIR 
MASSINGBERD:  good again, sir!  I wish he would plagiarise the 
death of Zero.

<p><b>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JAN. SOMETHINGOROTHER-TH, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - I send you two photographs:  they are both done by 
Sir Percy Shelley, the poet's son, which may interest.  The sitting 
down one is, I think, the best; but if they choose that, see that 
the little reflected light on the nose does not give me a turn-up; 
that would be tragic.  Don't forget 'Baronet' to Sir Percy's name.
</p><p>We all think a heap of your book; and I am well pleased with my 
dedication. - Yours ever,
</p><p>R. L. STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - APROPOS of the odd controversy about Shelley's nose:  I have 
before me four photographs of myself, done by Shelley's son:  my 
nose is hooked, not like the eagle, indeed, but like the 
accipitrine family in man:  well, out of these four, only one marks 
the bend, one makes it straight, and one suggests a turn-up.  This 
throws a flood of light on calumnious man - and the scandal-
mongering sun.  For personally I cling to my curve.  To continue 
the Shelley controversy:  I have a look of him, all his sisters had 
noses like mine; Sir Percy has a marked hook; all the family had 
high cheek-bones like mine; what doubt, then, but that this turn-up 
(of which Jeaffreson accuses the poet, along with much other 
FATRAS) is the result of some accident similar to what has happened 
in my photographs by his son?

<p><b>Letter:  TO THOMAS STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JANUARY 25, 1886.]
</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - Many thanks for a letter quite like yourself.  I 
quite agree with you, and had already planned a scene of religion 
in BALFOUR; the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge 
furnishes me with a catechist whom I shall try to make the man.  I 
have another catechist, the blind, pistol-carrying highway robber, 
whom I have transferred from the Long Island to Mull.  I find it a 
most picturesque period, and wonder Scott let it escape.  The 
COVENANT is lost on one of the Tarrans, and David is cast on 
Earraid, where (being from inland) he is nearly starved before he 
finds out the island is tidal; then he crosses Mull to Toronsay, 
meeting the blind catechist by the way; then crosses Morven from 
Kinlochaline to Kingairloch, where he stays the night with the good 
catechist; that is where I am; next day he is to be put ashore in 
Appin, and be present at Colin Campbell's death.  To-day I rest, 
being a little run down.  Strange how liable we are to brain fag in 
this scooty family!  But as far as I have got, all but the last 
chapter, I think David is on his feet, and (to my mind) a far 
better story and far sounder at heart than TREASURE ISLAND.
</p><p>I have no earthly news, living entirely in my story, and only 
coming out of it to play patience.  The Shelleys are gone; the 
Taylors kinder than can be imagined.  The other day, Lady Taylor 
drove over and called on me; she is a delightful old lady, and 
great fun.  I mentioned a story about the Duchess of Wellington 
which I had heard Sir Henry tell; and though he was very tired, he 
looked it up and copied it out for me in his own hand. - Your most 
affectionate son,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO C. W. STODDARD</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, FEB. 13TH, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR STODDARD, - I am a dreadful character; but, you see, I have 
at last taken pen in hand; how long I may hold it, God knows.  This 
is already my sixth letter to-day, and I have many more waiting; 
and my wrist gives me a jog on the subject of scrivener's cramp, 
which is not encouraging.
</p><p>I gather you were a little down in the jaw when you wrote your 
last.  I am as usual pretty cheerful, but not very strong.  I stay 
in the house all winter, which is base; but, as you continue to 
see, the pen goes from time to time, though neither fast enough nor 
constantly enough to please me.
</p><p>My wife is at Bath with my father and mother, and the interval of 
widowery explains my writing.  Another person writing for you when 
you have done work is a great enemy to correspondence.  To-day I 
feel out of health, and shan't work; and hence this so much overdue 
reply.
</p><p>I was re-reading some of your South Sea Idyls the other day:  some 
of the chapters are very good indeed; some pages as good as they 
can be.
</p><p>How does your class get along?  If you like to touch on OTTO, any 
day in a by-hour, you may tell them - as the author's last dying 
confession - that it is a strange example of the difficulty of 
being ideal in an age of realism; that the unpleasant giddy-
mindedness, which spoils the book and often gives it a wanton air 
of unreality and juggling with air-bells, comes from unsteadiness 
of key; from the too great realism of some chapters and passages - 
some of which I have now spotted, others I dare say I shall never 
spot - which disprepares the imagination for the cast of the 
remainder.
</p><p>Any story can be made TRUE in its own key; any story can be made 
FALSE by the choice of a wrong key of detail or style:  Otto is 
made to reel like a drunken - I was going to say man, but let us 
substitute cipher - by the variations of the key.  Have you 
observed that the famous problem of realism and idealism is one 
purely of detail?  Have you seen my 'Note on Realism' in Cassell's 
MAGAZINE OF ART; and 'Elements of Style' in the CONTEMPORARY; and 
'Romance' and 'Humble Apology' in LONGMAN'S?  They are all in your 
line of business; let me know what you have not seen and I'll send 
'em.
</p><p>I am glad I brought the old house up to you.  It was a pleasant old 
spot, and I remember you there, though still more dearly in your 
own strange den upon a hill in San Francisco; and one of the most 
San Francisco-y parts of San Francisco.
</p><p>Good-bye, my dear fellow, and believe me your friend,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO J. A. SYMONDS</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH [SPRING 1886].
</p><p>MY DEAR SYMONDS, - If we have lost touch, it is (I think) only in a 
material sense; a question of letters, not hearts.  You will find a 
warm welcome at Skerryvore from both the lightkeepers; and, indeed, 
we never tell ourselves one of our financial fairy tales, but a run 
to Davos is a prime feature.  I am not changeable in friendship; 
and I think I can promise you you have a pair of trusty well-
wishers and friends in Bournemouth:  whether they write or not is 
but a small thing; the flag may not be waved, but it is there.
</p><p>Jekyll is a dreadful thing, I own; but the only thing I feel 
dreadful about is that damned old business of the war in the 
members.  This time it came out; I hope it will stay in, in future.
</p><p>Raskolnikoff is easily the greatest book I have read in ten years; 
I am glad you took to it.  Many find it dull:  Henry James could 
not finish it:  all I can say is, it nearly finished me.  It was 
like having an illness.  James did not care for it because the 
character of Raskolnikoff was not objective; and at that I divined 
a great gulf between us, and, on further reflection, the existence 
of a certain impotence in many minds of to-day, which prevents them 
from living IN a book or a character, and keeps them standing afar 
off, spectators of a puppet show.  To such I suppose the book may 
seem empty in the centre; to the others it is a room, a house of 
life, into which they themselves enter, and are tortured and 
purified.  The Juge d'Instruction I thought a wonderful, weird, 
touching, ingenious creation:  the drunken father, and Sonia, and 
the student friend, and the uncircumscribed, protaplasmic humanity 
of Raskolnikoff, all upon a level that filled me with wonder:  the 
execution also, superb in places.  Another has been translated - 
HUMILIES ET OFFENSES.  It is even more incoherent than LE CRIME ET 
LE CHATIMENT, but breathes much of the same lovely goodness, and 
has passages of power.  Dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell, to be 
sure.  Have you heard that he became a stout, imperialist 
conservative?  It is interesting to know.  To something of that 
side, the balance leans with me also in view of the incoherency and 
incapacity of all.  The old boyish idea of the march on Paradise 
being now out of season, and all plans and ideas that I hear 
debated being built on a superb indifference to the first 
principles of human character, a helpless desire to acquiesce in 
anything of which I know the worst assails me.  Fundamental errors 
in human nature of two sorts stand on the skyline of all this modern 
world of aspirations.  First, that it is happiness that men want; 
and second, that happiness consists of anything but an internal 
harmony.  Men do not want, and I do not think they would accept, 
happiness; what they live for is rivalry, effort, success - the 
elements our friends wish to eliminate.  And, on the other hand, 
happiness is a question of morality - or of immorality, there is no 
difference - and conviction.  Gordon was happy in Khartoum, in his 
worst hours of danger and fatigue; Marat was happy, I suppose, in 
his ugliest frenzy; Marcus Aurelius was happy in the detested camp; 
Pepys was pretty happy, and I am pretty happy on the whole, because 
we both somewhat crowingly accepted a VIA MEDIA, both liked to 
attend to our affairs, and both had some success in managing the 
same.  It is quite an open question whether Pepys and I ought to be 
happy; on the other hand, there is no doubt that Marat had better 
be unhappy.  He was right (if he said it) that he was LA MISERE 
HUMAINE, cureless misery - unless perhaps by the gallows.  Death is 
a great and gentle solvent; it has never had justice done it, no, 
not by Whitman.  As for those crockery chimney-piece ornaments, the 
bourgeois (QUORUM PARS), and their cowardly dislike of dying and 
killing, it is merely one symptom of a thousand how utterly they 
have got out of touch of life.  Their dislike of capital punishment 
and their treatment of their domestic servants are for me the two 
flaunting emblems of their hollowness.
</p><p>God knows where I am driving to.  But here comes my lunch.
</p><p>Which interruption, happily for you, seems to have stayed the 
issue.  I have now nothing to say, that had formerly such a 
pressure of twaddle.  Pray don't fail to come this summer.  It will 
be a great disappointment, now it has been spoken of, if you do. - 
Yours ever,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, MARCH 1886.]
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - This is the most enchanting picture.  Now understand 
my state:  I am really an invalid, but of a mysterious order.  I 
might be a MALADE IMAGINAIRE, but for one too tangible symptom, my 
tendency to bleed from the lungs.  If we could go, (1ST)  We must 
have money enough to travel with LEISURE AND COMFORT - especially 
the first.  (2ND)  You must be prepared for a comrade who would go 
to bed some part of every day and often stay silent (3RD)  You 
would have to play the part of a thoughtful courier, sparing me 
fatigue, looking out that my bed was warmed, etc. (4TH)  If you are 
very nervous, you must recollect a bad haemorrhage is always on the 
cards, with its concomitants of anxiety and horror for those who 
are beside me.
</p><p>Do you blench?  If so, let us say no more about it.
</p><p>If you are still unafraid, and the money were forthcoming, I 
believe the trip might do me good, and I feel sure that, working 
together, we might produce a fine book.  The Rhone is the river of 
Angels.  I adore it:  have adored it since I was twelve, and first 
saw it from the train.
</p><p>Lastly, it would depend on how I keep from now on.  I have stood 
the winter hitherto with some credit, but the dreadful weather 
still continues, and I cannot holloa till I am through the wood.
</p><p>Subject to these numerous and gloomy provisos, I embrace the 
prospect with glorious feelings.
</p><p>I write this from bed, snow pouring without, and no circumstance of 
pleasure except your letter.  That, however, counts for much.  I am 
glad you liked the doggerel:  I have already had a liberal cheque, 
over which I licked my fingers with a sound conscience.  I had not 
meant to make money by these stumbling feet, but if it comes, it is 
only too welcome in my handsome but impecunious house.
</p><p>Let me know soon what is to be expected - as far as it does not 
hang by that inconstant quantity, my want of health.  Remember me 
to Madam with the best thanks and wishes; and believe me your 
friend,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. FLEEMING JENKIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, APRIL 1886.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - I try to tell myself it is good nature, but 
I know it is vanity that makes me write.
</p><p>I have drafted the first part of Chapter VI., Fleeming and his 
friends, his influence on me, his views on religion and literature, 
his part at the Savile; it should boil down to about ten pages, and 
I really do think it admirably good.  It has so much evoked 
Fleeming for myself that I found my conscience stirred just as it 
used to be after a serious talk with him:  surely that means it is 
good?  I had to write and tell you, being alone.
</p><p>I have excellent news of Fanny, who is much better for the change.  
My father is still very yellow, and very old, and very weak, but 
yesterday he seemed happier, and smiled, and followed what was 
said; even laughed, I think.  When he came away, he said to me, 
'Take care of yourself, my dearie,' which had a strange sound of 
childish days, and will not leave my mind.
</p><p>You must get Litolf's GAVOTTES CELEBRES:  I have made another 
trover there:  a musette of Lully's.  The second part of it I have 
not yet got the hang of; but the first - only a few bars!  The 
gavotte is beautiful and pretty hard, I think, and very much of the 
period; and at the end of it, this musette enters with the most 
really thrilling effect of simple beauty.  O - it's first-rate.  I 
am quite mad over it.  If you find other books containing Lully, 
Rameau, Martini, please let me know; also you might tell me, you 
who know Bach, where the easiest is to be found.  I write all 
morning, come down, and never leave the piano till about five; 
write letters, dine, get down again about eight, and never leave 
the piano till I go to bed.  This is a fine life. - Yours most 
sincerely,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>If you get the musette (Lully's), please tell me if I am right, and 
it was probably written for strings.  Anyway, it is as neat as - as 
neat as Bach - on the piano; or seems so to my ignorance.
</p><p>I play much of the Rigadoon but it is strange, it don't come off 
QUITE so well with me!
</p><p>[Musical score which cannot be reproduced]
</p><p>There is the first part of the musette copied (from memory, so I 
hope there's nothing wrong).  Is it not angelic?  But it ought, of 
course, to have the gavotte before.  The gavotte is in G, and ends 
on the keynote thus (if I remember):-
</p><p>[Musical score which cannot be reproduced]
</p><p>staccato, I think.  Then you sail into the musette.
</p><p>N.B. - Where I have put an 'A,' is that a dominant eleventh, or 
what? or just a seventh on the D? and if the latter, is that 
allowed?  It sounds very funny.  Never mind all my questions; if I 
begin about music (which is my leading ignorance and curiosity), I 
have always to babble questions:  all my friends know me now, and 
take no notice whatever.  The whole piece is marked allegro; but 
surely could easily be played too fast?  The dignity must not be 
lost; the periwig feeling.

</p><p>MY DEAR FATHER, - The David problem has to-day been decided.  I am 
to leave the door open for a sequel if the public take to it, and 
this will save me from butchering a lot of good material to no 
purpose.  Your letter from Carlisle was pretty like yourself, sir, 
as I was pleased to see; the hand of Jekyll, not the hand of Hyde.  
I am for action quite unfit, and even a letter is beyond me; so 
pray take these scraps at a vast deal more than their intrinsic 
worth.  I am in great spirits about David, Colvin agreeing with 
Henley, Fanny, and myself in thinking it far the most human of my 
labours hitherto.  As to whether the long-eared British public may 
take to it, all think it more than doubtful; I wish they would, for 
I could do a second volume with ease and pleasure, and Colvin 
thinks it sin and folly to throw away David and Alan Breck upon so 
small a field as this one. - Ever your affectionate son,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. FLEEMING JENKIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], APRIL 15 OR 16 (THE HOUR NOT BEING 
KNOWN), 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - It is I know not what hour of the night; but 
I cannot sleep, have lit the gas, and here goes.
</p><p>First, all your packet arrived:  I have dipped into the Schumann 
already with great pleasure.  Surely, in what concerns us there is 
a sweet little chirrup; the GOOD WORDS arrived in the morning just 
when I needed it, and the famous notes that I had lost were 
recovered also in the nick of time.
</p><p>And now I am going to bother you with my affairs:  premising, 
first, that this is PRIVATE; second, that whatever I do the LIFE 
shall be done first, and I am getting on with it well; and third, 
that I do not quite know why I consult you, but something tells me 
you will hear with fairness.
</p><p>Here is my problem.  The Curtin women are still miserable 
prisoners; no one dare buy their farm of them, all the manhood of 
England and the world stands aghast before a threat of murder.  (1) 
Now, my work can be done anywhere; hence I can take up without loss 
a back-going Irish farm, and live on, though not (as I had 
originally written) in it:  First Reason.  (2) If I should be 
killed, there are a good many who would feel it:  writers are so 
much in the public eye, that a writer being murdered would attract 
attention, throw a bull's-eye light upon this cowardly business:  
Second Reason.  (3) I am not unknown in the States, from which the 
funds come that pay for these brutalities:  to some faint extent, 
my death (if I should be killed) would tell there:  Third Reason.  
(4) NOBODY ELSE IS TAKING UP THIS OBVIOUS AND CRYING DULY:  Fourth 
Reason.  (5) I have a crazy health and may die at any moment, my 
life is of no purchase in an insurance office, it is the less 
account to husband it, and the business of husbanding a life is 
dreary and demoralising:  Fifth Reason.
</p><p>I state these in no order, but as they occur to me.  And I shall do 
the like with the objections.
</p><p>First Objection:  It will do no good; you have seen Gordon die and 
nobody minded; nobody will mind if you die.  This is plainly of the 
devil.  Second Objection:  You will not even be murdered, the 
climate will miserably kill you, you will strangle out in a rotten 
damp heat, in congestion, etc.  Well, what then?  It changes 
nothing:  the purpose is to brave crime; let me brave it, for such 
time and to such an extent as God allows.  Third Objection:  The 
Curtin women are probably highly uninteresting females.  I haven't 
a doubt of it.  But the Government cannot, men will not, protect 
them.  If I am the only one to see this public duty, it is to the 
public and the Right I should perform it - not to Mesdames Curtin.  
Fourth Objection:  I am married.  'I have married a wife!'  I seem 
to have heard it before.  It smells ancient! what was the context?  
Fifth Objection:  My wife has had a mean life (1), loves me (2), 
could not bear to lose me (3).  (1) I admit:  I am sorry.  (2) But 
what does she love me for? and (3) she must lose me soon or late.  
And after all, because we run this risk, it does not follow we 
should fail.  Sixth Objection:  My wife wouldn't like it.  No, she 
wouldn't.  Who would?  But the Curtins don't like it.  And all 
those who are to suffer if this goes on, won't like it.  And if 
there is a great wrong, somebody must suffer.  Seventh Objection:  
I won't like it.  No, I will not; I have thought it through, and I 
will not.  But what of that?  And both she and I may like it more 
than we suppose.  We shall lose friends, all comforts, all society:  
so has everybody who has ever done anything; but we shall have some 
excitement, and that's a fine thing; and we shall be trying to do 
the right, and that's not to be despised.  Eighth Objection:  I am 
an author with my work before me.  See Second Reason.  Ninth 
Objection:  But am I not taken with the hope of excitement?  I was 
at first.  I am not much now.  I see what a dreary, friendless, 
miserable, God-forgotten business it will be.  And anyway, is not 
excitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a 
little dangerous?  Tenth Objection:  But am I not taken with a 
notion of glory?  I dare say I am.  Yet I see quite clearly how all 
points to nothing coming, to a quite inglorious death by disease 
and from the lack of attendance; or even if I should be knocked on 
the head, as these poor Irish promise, how little any one will 
care.  It will be a smile at a thousand breakfast-tables.  I am 
nearly forty now; I have not many illusions.  And if I had?  I do 
not love this health-tending, housekeeping life of mine.  I have a 
taste for danger, which is human, like the fear of it.  Here is a 
fair cause; a just cause; no knight ever set lance in rest for a 
juster.  Yet it needs not the strength I have not, only the passive 
courage that I hope I could muster, and the watchfulness that I am 
sure I could learn.
</p><p>Here is a long midnight dissertation; with myself; with you.  
Please let me hear.  But I charge you this:  if you see in this 
idea of mine the finger of duty, do not dissuade me.  I am nearing 
forty, I begin to love my ease and my home and my habits, I never 
knew how much till this arose; do not falsely counsel me to put my 
head under the bed-clothes.  And I will say this to you:  my wife, 
who hates the idea, does not refuse.  'It is nonsense,' says she, 
'but if you go, I will go.'  Poor girl, and her home and her garden 
that she was so proud of!  I feel her garden most of all, because 
it is a pleasure (I suppose) that I do not feel myself to share.
</p><p>1. Here is a great wrong.
2. " growing wrong.
3. " wrong founded on crime.
4. " crime that the Government cannot prevent.
5. " crime that it occurs to no man to defy.
6. But it has occurred to me.
7. Being a known person, some will notice my defiance.
8. Being a writer, I can MAKE people notice it.
9. And, I think, MAKE people imitate me.
10. Which would destroy in time this whole scaffolding of 
oppression.
11. And if I fail, however ignominiously, that is not my concern.  
It is, with an odd mixture of reverence and humorous remembrances 
of Dickens, be it said - it is A-nother's.
</p><p>And here, at I cannot think what hour of the morning, I shall dry 
up, and remain, - Yours, really in want of a little help,
</p><p>R. L S.
</p><p>Sleepless at midnight's dewy hour.

<p>NEXT MORNING. - Eleventh Objection:  I have a father and mother.  
And who has not?  Macduff's was a rare case; if we must wait for a 
Macduff.  Besides, my father will not perhaps be long here.  
Twelfth Objection:  The cause of England in Ireland is not worth 
supporting.  A QUI LE DITES-VOUS?  And I am not supporting that.  
Home Rule, if you like.  Cause of decency, the idea that 
populations should not be taught to gain public ends by private 
crime, the idea that for all men to bow before a threat of crime is 
to loosen and degrade beyond redemption the whole fabric of man's 
decency.

<p><b>Letter:  TO MRS. FLEEMING JENKIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, APRIL 1886.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - The Book - It is all drafted:  I hope soon 
to send you for comments Chapters III., IV., and V.  Chapter VII. 
is roughly but satisfactorily drafted:  a very little work should 
put that to rights.  But Chapter VI. is no joke; it is a MARE 
MAGNUM:  I swim and drown and come up again; and it is all broken 
ends and mystification:  moreover, I perceive I am in want of more 
matter.  I must have, first of all, a little letter from Mr. Ewing 
about the phonograph work:  IF you think he would understand it is 
quite a matter of chance whether I use a word or a fact out of it.  
If you think he would not:  I will go without.  Also, could I have 
a look at Ewing's PRECIS?  And lastly, I perceive I must interview 
you again about a few points; they are very few, and might come to 
little; and I propose to go on getting things as well together as I 
can in the meanwhile, and rather have a final time when all is 
ready and only to be criticised.  I do still think it will be good.  
I wonder if Trelat would let me cut?  But no, I think I wouldn't 
after all; 'tis so quaint and pretty and clever and simple and 
French, and gives such a good sight of Fleeming:  the plum of the 
book, I think.
</p><p>You misunderstood me in one point:  I always hoped to found such a 
society; that was the outside of my dream, and would mean entire 
success.  BUT - I cannot play Peter the Hermit.  In these days of 
the Fleet Street journalist, I cannot send out better men than 
myself, with wives or mothers just as good as mine, and sisters (I 
may at least say) better, to a danger and a long-drawn dreariness 
that I do not share.  My wife says it's cowardice; what brave men 
are the leader-writers!  Call it cowardice; it is mine.  Mind you, 
I may end by trying to do it by the pen only:  I shall not love 
myself if I do; and is it ever a good thing to do a thing for which 
you despise yourself? - even in the doing?  And if the thing you do 
is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect?  I have never 
dared to say what I feel about men's lives, because my own was in 
the wrong:  shall I dare to send them to death?  The physician must 
heal himself; he must honestly TRY the path he recommends:  if he 
does not even try, should he not be silent?
</p><p>I thank you very heartily for your letter, and for the seriousness 
you brought to it.  You know, I think when a serious thing is your 
own, you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go.  
So I do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened 
gravity I feel.  And indeed, what with the book, and this business 
to which I referred, and Ireland, I am scarcely in an enviable 
state.  Well, I ought to be glad, after ten years of the worst 
training on earth - valetudinarianism - that I can still be 
troubled by a duty.  You shall hear more in time; so far, I am at 
least decided:  I will go and see Balfour when I get to London.
</p><p>We have all had a great pleasure:  a Mrs. Rawlinson came and 
brought with her a nineteen-year-old daughter, simple, human, as 
beautiful as - herself; I never admired a girl before, you know it 
was my weakness:  we are all three dead in love with her.  How nice 
to be able to do so much good to harassed people by - yourself!  
Ever yours,

<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS MONROE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, MAY 25TH, 1886.
</p><p>DEAR MISS MONROE, - (I hope I have this rightly) I must lose no 
time in thanking you for a letter singularly pleasant to receive.  
It may interest you to know that I read to the signature without 
suspecting my correspondent was a woman; though in one point (a 
reference to the Countess) I might have found a hint of the truth.  
You are not pleased with Otto; since I judge you do not like 
weakness; and no more do I.  And yet I have more than tolerance for 
Otto, whose faults are the faults of weakness, but never of ignoble 
weakness, and who seeks before all to be both kind and just.  
Seeks, not succeeds.  But what is man?  So much of cynicism to 
recognise that nobody does right is the best equipment for those 
who do not wish to be cynics in good earnest.  Think better of 
Otto, if my plea can influence you; and this I mean for your own 
sake - not his, poor fellow, as he will never learn your opinion; 
but for yours, because, as men go in this world (and women too), 
you will not go far wrong if you light upon so fine a fellow; and 
to light upon one and not perceive his merits is a calamity.  In 
the flesh, of course, I mean; in the book the fault, of course, is 
with my stumbling pen.  Seraphina made a mistake about her Otto; it 
begins to swim before me dimly that you may have some traits of 
Seraphina?
</p><p>With true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your exception; but it 
is easier to defend oneself gracefully than to acknowledge praise.  
I am truly glad that you should like my books; for I think I see 
from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing.  Your 
name, if I have properly deciphered it, suggests that you may be 
also something of my countrywoman; for it is hard to see where 
Monroe came from, if not from Scotland.  I seem to have here a 
double claim on your good nature:  being myself pure Scotch and 
having appreciated your letter, make up two undeniable merits 
which, perhaps, if it should be quite without trouble, you might 
reward with your photograph. - Yours truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO MISS MONROE</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JUNE 1886.]
</p><p>MY DEAR MISS MONROE, - I am ill in bed and stupid, incoherently 
stupid; yet I have to answer your letter, and if the answer is 
incomprehensible you must forgive me.  You say my letter caused you 
pleasure; I am sure, as it fell out, not near so much as yours has 
brought to me.  The interest taken in an author is fragile:  his 
next book, or your next year of culture, might see the interest 
frosted or outgrown; and himself, in spite of all, you might 
probably find the most distasteful person upon earth.  My case is 
different.  I have bad health, am often condemned to silence for 
days together - was so once for six weeks, so that my voice was 
awful to hear when I first used it, like the whisper of a shadow - 
have outlived all my chief pleasures, which were active and 
adventurous, and ran in the open air:  and being a person who 
prefers life to art, and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in 
love, or to risk a danger, than to paint the finest picture or 
write the noblest book, I begin to regard what remains to me of my 
life as very shadowy.  From a variety of reasons, I am ashamed to 
confess I was much in this humour when your letter came.  I had a 
good many troubles; was regretting a high average of sins; had been 
recently reminded that I had outlived some friends, and wondering 
if I had not outlived some friendships; and had just, while 
boasting of better health, been struck down again by my haunting 
enemy, an enemy who was exciting at first, but has now, by the 
iteration of his strokes, become merely annoying and inexpressibly 
irksome.  Can you fancy that to a person drawing towards the 
elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather 
aching sense of the past and the future?  Well, it was just then 
that your letter and your photograph were brought to me in bed; and 
there came to me at once the most agreeable sense of triumph.  My 
books were still young; my words had their good health and could go 
about the world and make themselves welcome; and even (in a shadowy 
and distant sense) make something in the nature of friends for the 
sheer hulk that stays at home and bites his pen over the 
manuscripts.  It amused me very much to remember that I had been in 
Chicago, not so many years ago, in my proper person; where I had 
failed to awaken much remark, except from the ticket collector; and 
to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows that 
I now send instead of me, and how these are welcome in that quarter 
to the sitter of Herr Platz, while their author was not very 
welcome even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a 
meal and rather failed.
</p><p>And this leads me directly to a confession.  The photograph which 
shall accompany this is not chosen as the most like, but the best-
looking.  Put yourself in my place, and you will call this 
pardonable.  Even as it is, even putting forth a flattered 
presentment, I am a little pained; and very glad it is a photograph 
and not myself that has to go; for in this case, if it please you, 
you can tell yourself it is my image - and if it displeased you, 
you can lay the blame on the photographer; but in that, there were 
no help, and the poor author might belie his labours.
</p><p>KIDNAPPED should soon appear; I am afraid you may not like it, as 
it is very unlike PRINCE OTTO in every way; but I am myself a great 
admirer of the two chief characters, Alan and David.  VIRGINIBUS 
PUERISQUE has never been issued in the States.  I do not think it 
is a book that has much charm for publishers in any land; but I am 
to bring out a new edition in England shortly, a copy of which I 
must try to remember to send you.  I say try to remember, because I 
have some superficial acquaintance with myself:  and I have 
determined, after a galling discipline, to promise nothing more 
until the day of my death:  at least, in this way, I shall no more 
break my word, and I must now try being churlish instead of being 
false.
</p><p>I do not believe you to be the least like Seraphina.  Your 
photograph has no trace of her, which somewhat relieves me, as I am 
a good deal afraid of Seraphinas - they do not always go into the 
woods and see the sunrise, and some are so well-mailed that even 
that experience would leave them unaffected and unsoftened.  The 
'hair and eyes of several complexions' was a trait taken from 
myself; and I do not bind myself to the opinions of Sir John.  In 
this case, perhaps - but no, if the peculiarity is shared by two 
such pleasant persons as you and I (as you and me - the grammatical 
nut is hard), it must be a very good thing indeed, and Sir John 
must be an ass.
</p><p>The BOOK READER notice was a strange jumble of fact and fancy.  I 
wish you could have seen my father's old assistant and present 
partner when he heard my father described as an 'inspector of 
lighthouses,' for we are all very proud of the family achievements, 
and the name of my house here in Bournemouth is stolen from one of 
the sea-towers of the Hebrides which are our pyramids and 
monuments.  I was never at Cambridge, again; but neglected a 
considerable succession of classes at Edinburgh.  But to correct 
that friendly blunderer were to write an autobiography. - And so 
now, with many thanks, believe me yours sincerely,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO R. A. M. STEVENSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JULY 1886.
</p><p>SIR, - Your foolish letter was unduly received.  There may be 
hidden fifths, and if there are, it shows how dam spontaneous the 
thing was.  I could tinker and tic-tac-toe on a piece of paper, but 
scorned the act with a Threnody, which was poured forth like blood 
and water on the groaning organ.  If your heart (which was what I 
addressed) remained unmoved, let us refer to the affair no more:  
crystallised emotion, the statement and the reconciliation of the 
sorrows of the race and the individual, is obviously no more to you 
than supping sawdust.  Well, well.  If ever I write another 
Threnody!  My next op. will probably be a Passepied and fugue in G 
(or D).
</p><p>The mind is in my case shrunk to the size and sp. gr. of an aged 
Spanish filbert.  O, I am so jolly silly.  I now pickle with some 
freedom (1) the refrain of MARTINI'S MOUTONS; (2) SUL MARGINE D'UN 
RIO, arranged for the infant school by the Aged Statesman; (3) the 
first phrase of Bach's musette (Sweet Englishwoman, No. 3), the 
rest of the musette being one prolonged cropper, which I take daily 
for the benefit of my health.  All my other works (of which there 
are many) are either arranged (by R. L. Stevenson) for the manly 
and melodious forefinger, or else prolonged and melancholy 
croppers. . . . I find one can get a notion of music very nicely.  
I have been pickling deeply in the Magic Flute; and have arranged 
LA DOVE PRENDE, almost to the end, for two melodious forefingers.  
I am next going to score the really nobler COLOMBA O TORTORELLA for 
the same instruments.
</p><p>This day is published
The works of Ludwig van Beethoven

</p><p>PIMPERLY STIPPLE.
</p><p>That's a good idea?  There's a person called Lenz who actually does 
it - beware his den; I lost eighteenpennies on him, and found the 
bleeding corpses of pieces of music divorced from their keys, 
despoiled of their graces, and even changed in time; I do not wish 
to regard music (nor to be regarded) through that bony Lenz.  You 
say you are 'a spumfed idiot'; but how about Lenz?  And how about 
me, sir, me?
</p><p>I yesterday sent Lloyd by parcel post, at great expense, an empty 
matchbox and empty cigarette-paper book, a bell from a cat's 
collar, an iron kitchen spoon, and a piece of coal more than half 
the superficies of this sheet of paper.  They are now 
(appropriately enough) speeding towards the Silly Isles; I hope he 
will find them useful.  By that, and my telegram with prepaid 
answer to yourself, you may judge of my spiritual state.  The 
finances have much brightened; and if KIDNAPPED keeps on as it has 
begun, I may be solvent. - Yours,

I think not so abjectly idiotic.  The musical terms seem to be as

Bar the dam bareness of the base, it looks like a piece of real

</p><p>MY DEAR PEOPLE, - It is probably my fault, and not yours, that I 
did not understand.  I think it would be well worth trying the 
winter in Bournemouth; but I would only take the house by the month 
- this after mature discussion.  My leakage still pursues its 
course; if I were only well, I have a notion to go north and get in 
(if I could) at the inn at Kirkmichael, which has always smiled 
upon me much.  If I did well there, we might then meet and do what 
should most smile at the time.
</p><p>Meanwhile, of course, I must not move, and am in a rancid box here, 
feeling the heat a great deal, and pretty tired of things.  
Alexander did a good thing of me at last; it looks like a mixture 
of an aztec idol, a lion, an Indian Rajah, and a woman; and 
certainly represents a mighty comic figure.  F. and Lloyd both 
think it is the best thing that has been done of me up to now.
</p><p>You should hear Lloyd on the penny whistle, and me on the piano!  
Dear powers, what a concerto!  I now live entirely for the piano, 
he for the whistle; the neighbours, in a radius of a furlong and a 
half, are packing up in quest of brighter climes. - Ever yours,

make this change on my own metal.

England; like Alan, 'I weary for the heather,' if not for the deer.  
Lloyd has gone to Scilly with Katharine and C., where and with whom 
he should have a good time.  David seems really to be going to

Gullane, where (as I dare say you remember) he gaed clean gyte, and 
jumped on to his crown from a gig, in hot and hopeless chase of 
many thousand rabbits.  I can still hear the little cries of the

<p><b>Letter:  TO T. WATTS-DUNTON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH [SEPTEMBER 1886].
</p><p>DEAR MR. WATTS, The sight of the last ATHENAEUM reminds me of you, 
and of my debt, now too long due.  I wish to thank you for your 
notice of KIDNAPPED; and that not because it was kind, though for 
that also I valued it, but in the same sense as I have thanked you 
before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers.  
A critic like you is one who fights the good fight, contending with 
stupidity, and I would fain hope not all in vain; in my own case, 
for instance, surely not in vain.
</p><p>What you say of the two parts in KIDNAPPED was felt by no one more 
painfully than by myself.  I began it partly as a lark, partly as a 
pot-boiler; and suddenly it moved, David and Alan stepped out from 
the canvas, and I found I was in another world.  But there was the 
cursed beginning, and a cursed end must be appended; and our old 
friend Byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back 
door.  So it had to go into the world, one part (as it does seem to 
me) alive, one part merely galvanised:  no work, only an essay.  
For a man of tentative method, and weak health, and a scarcity of 
private means, and not too much of that frugality which is the 
artist's proper virtue, the days of sinecures and patrons look very 
golden:  the days of professional literature very hard.  Yet I do 
not so far deceive myself as to think I should change my character 
by changing my epoch; the sum of virtue in our books is in a 
relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves; and my 
KIDNAPPED was doomed, while still in the womb and while I was yet 
in the cradle, to be the thing it is.
</p><p>And now to the more genial business of defence.  You attack my 
fight on board the COVENANT:  I think it literal.  David and Alan 
had every advantage on their side - position, arms, training, a 
good conscience; a handful of merchant sailors, not well led in the 
first attack, not led at all in the second, could only by an 
accident have taken the round-house by attack; and since the 
defenders had firearms and food, it is even doubtful if they could 
have been starved out.  The only doubtful point with me is whether 
the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught; I half 
believe they would not; still the illusion of numbers and the 
authority of Hoseason would perhaps stretch far enough to justify 
the extremity. - I am, dear Mr. Watts, your very sincere admirer,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

</p><p>DEAR LOCKER, - You take my verses too kindly, but you will admit, 
for such a bluebottle of a versifier to enter the house of 
Gertrude, where her necklace hangs, was not a little brave.  Your 
kind invitation, I fear, must remain unaccented; and yet - if I am 
very well - perhaps next spring - (for I mean to be very well) - my 
wife might....  But all that is in the clouds with my better 
health.  And now look here:  you are a rich man and know many 
people, therefore perhaps some of the Governors of Christ's 
Hospital.  If you do, I know a most deserving case, in which I 
would (if I could) do anything.  To approach you, in this way, is 
not decent; and you may therefore judge by my doing it, how near 
this matter lies to my heart.  I enclose you a list of the 
Governors, which I beg you to return, whether or not you shall be 
able to do anything to help me.
</p><p>The boy's name is -; he and his mother are very poor.  It may 
interest you in her cause if I tell you this:  that when I was 
dangerously ill at Hyeres, this brave lady, who had then a sick 
husband of her own (since dead) and a house to keep and a family of 
four to cook for, all with her own hands, for they could afford no 
servant, yet took watch-about with my wife, and contributed not 
only to my comfort, but to my recovery in a degree that I am not 
able to limit.  You can conceive how much I suffer from my 
impotence to help her, and indeed I have already shown myself a 
thankless friend.  Let not my cry go up before you in vain! - Yours 
in hope,

<p><b>Letter:  TO FREDERICK LOCKER-LAMPSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, SEPTEMBER 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOCKER, - That I should call myself a man of letters, and 
land myself in such unfathomable ambiguities!  No, my dear Locker, 
I did not want a cheque; and in my ignorance of business, which is 
greater even than my ignorance of literature, I have taken the 
liberty of drawing a pen through the document and returning it; 
should this be against the laws of God or man, forgive me.  All 
that I meant by my excessively disgusting reference to your 
material well-being was the vague notion that a man who is well off 
was sure to know a Governor of Christ's Hospital; though how I 
quite arrived at this conclusion I do not see.  A man with a cold 
in the head does not necessarily know a ratcatcher; and the 
connection is equally close - as it now appears to my awakened and 
somewhat humbled spirit.  For all that, let me thank you in the 
warmest manner for your friendly readiness to contribute.  You say 
you have hopes of becoming a miser:  I wish I had; but indeed I 
believe you deceive yourself, and are as far from it as ever.  I 
wish I had any excuse to keep your cheque, for it is much more 
elegant to receive than to return; but I have my way of making it 
up to you, and I do sincerely beg you to write to the two 
Governors.  This extraordinary outpouring of correspondence would 
(if you knew my habits) convince you of my great eagerness in this 
matter.  I would promise gratitude; but I have made a promise to 
myself to make no more promises to anybody else, having broken such 
a host already, and come near breaking my heart in consequence; and 
as for gratitude, I am by nature a thankless dog, and was spoiled 
from a child up.  But if you can help this lady in the matter of 
the Hospital, you will have helped the worthy.  Let me continue to 
hope that I shall make out my visit in the spring, and believe me, 
yours very truly,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>It may amuse you to know that a very long while ago, I broke my 
heart to try to imitate your verses, and failed hopelessly.  I saw 
some of the evidences the other day among my papers, and blushed to 
the heels.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>I give up finding out your name in the meantime, and keep to that 
by which you will be known - Frederick Locker.

<p><b>Letter:  TO FREDERICK LOCKER-LAMPSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH], 24TH SEPTEMBER 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOCKER, - You are simply an angel of light, and your two 
letters have gone to the post; I trust they will reach the hearts 
of the recipients - at least, that could not be more handsomely 
expressed.  About the cheque:  well now, I am going to keep it; but 
I assure you Mrs. - has never asked me for money, and I would not 
dare to offer any till she did.  For all that I shall stick to the 
cheque now, and act to that amount as your almoner.  In this way I 
reward myself for the ambiguity of my epistolary style.
</p><p>I suppose, if you please, you may say your verses are thin (would 
you so describe an arrow, by the way, and one that struck the gold?  
It scarce strikes me as exhaustively descriptive), and, thin or 
not, they are (and I have found them) inimitably elegant.  I thank 
you again very sincerely for the generous trouble you have taken in 
this matter which was so near my heart, and you may be very certain 
it will be the fault of my health and not my inclination, if I do 
not see you before very long; for all that has past has made me in 
more than the official sense sincerely yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, DEC. 14, 1886.
</p><p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - This is first-rate of you, the Lord love you for 
it!  I am truly much obliged.  He - my father - is very changeable; 
at times, he seems only a slow quiet edition of himself; again, he 
will be very heavy and blank; but never so violent as last spring; 
and therefore, to my mind, better on the whole.
</p><p>Fanny is pretty peepy; I am splendid.  I have been writing much 
verse - quite the bard, in fact; and also a dam tale to order, 
which will be what it will be:  I don't love it, but some of it is 
passable in its mouldy way, THE MISADVENTURES OF JOHN NICHOLSON.  
All my bardly exercises are in Scotch; I have struck my somewhat 
ponderous guitar in that tongue to no small extent:  with what 
success, I know not, but I think it's better than my English verse; 
more marrow and fatness, and more ruggedness.
</p><p>How goes KEATS?  Pray remark, if he (Keats) hung back from Shelley, 
it was not to be wondered at, WHEN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS WERE 
SHELLEY'S PENSIONERS.  I forget if you have made this point; it has 
been borne in upon me reading Dowden and the SHELLEY PAPERS; and it 
will do no harm if you have made it.  I finished a poem to-day, and 
writ 3000 words of a story, TANT BIEN QUE MAL; and have a right to 
be sleepy, and (what is far nobler and rarer) am so. - My dear 
Colvin, ever yours,
</p><p>THE REAL MACKAY.
</p>

<p><b>Letter:  TO FREDERICK LOCKER-LAMPSON</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, FEBRUARY 5TH, 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAR LOCKER, - Here I am in my bed as usual, and it is indeed a 
long while since I went out to dinner.  You do not know what a 
crazy fellow this is.  My winter has not so far been luckily 
passed, and all hope of paying visits at Easter has vanished for 
twelve calendar months.  But because I am a beastly and indurated 
invalid, I am not dead to human feelings; and I neither have 
forgotten you nor will forget you.  Some day the wind may round to 
the right quarter and we may meet; till then I am still truly 
yours,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.

<p><b>Letter:  TO HENRY JAMES</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, FEBRUARY 1887.]
</p><p>MY DEAR JAMES, - My health has played me it in once more in the 
absurdest fashion, and the creature who now addresses you is but a 
stringy and white-faced BOUILLI out of the pot of fever, with the 
devil to pay in every corner of his economy.  I suppose (to judge 
by your letter) I need not send you these sheets, which came during 
my collapse by the rush.  I am on the start with three volumes, 
that one of tales, a second one of essays, and one of - ahem - 
verse.  This is a great order, is it not?  After that I shall have 
empty lockers.  All new work stands still; I was getting on well 
with Jenkin when this blessed malady unhorsed me, and sent me back 
to the dung-collecting trade of the republisher.  I shall re-issue 
VIRG. PUER. as Vol. I. of ESSAYS, and the new vol. as Vol. II. of 
ditto; to be sold, however, separately.  This is but a dry 
maundering; however, I am quite unfit - 'I am for action quite 
unfit Either of exercise or wit.'  My father is in a variable 
state; many sorrows and perplexities environ the house of 
Stevenson; my mother shoots north at this hour on business of a 
distinctly rancid character; my father (under my wife's tutorage) 
proceeds to-morrow to Salisbury; I remain here in my bed and 
whistle; in no quarter of heaven is anything encouraging apparent, 
except that the good Colvin comes to the hotel here on a visit.  
This dreary view of life is somewhat blackened by the fact that my 
head aches, which I always regard as a liberty on the part of the 
powers that be.  This is also my first letter since my recovery.  
God speed your laudatory pen!
</p><p>My wife joins in all warm messages. - Yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO W. H. LOW</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>(APRIL 1887.)
</p><p>MY DEAR LOW, - The fares to London may be found in any continental 
Bradshaw or sich; from London to Bournemouth impoverished parties 
who can stoop to the third class get their ticket for the matter of 
10s., or, as my wife loves to phrase it, 'a half a pound.'  You 
will also be involved in a 3s. fare to get to Skerryvore; but this, 
I dare say, friends could help you in on your arrival; so that you 
may reserve your energies for the two tickets - costing the matter 
of a pound - and the usual gratuities to porters.  This does not 
seem to me much:  considering the intellectual pleasures that await 
you here, I call it dirt cheap.  I BELIEVE the third class from 
Paris to London (VIA Dover) is ABOUT forty francs, but I cannot 
swear.  Suppose it to be fifty.
</p><p>50x2=100
</p><p>The expense of spirit or spontaneous lapse of coin on the journey, 
at 5 frcs. a head, 5x2=10
</p><p>Victuals on ditto, at 5 frcs. a head, 5x2 = 10
</p><p>Gratuity to stewardess, in case of severe prostration, at 3 francs
</p><p>One night in London, on a modest footing, say 20
</p><p>Two tickets to Bournemouth at 12.50, 12.50x2=25
</p><p>Porters and general devilment, say 5
</p><p>Cabs in London, say 2 shillings, and in Bournemouth, 3 shillings=5 
shillings, 6 frcs. 25
</p><p>Total frcs. 179.25
</p><p>Or, the same in pounds, 7 pounds, 3s. 6 and a half d.
</p><p>Or, the same in dollars, $35.45,
</p><p>if there be any arithmetical virtue in me.  I have left out dinner 
in London in case you want to blow out, which would come extry, and 
with the aid of VANGS FANGS might easily double the whole amount - 
above all if you have a few friends to meet you.
</p><p>In making this valuable project, or budget, I discovered for the 
first time a reason (frequently overlooked) for the singular 
costliness of travelling with your wife.  Anybody would count the 
tickets double; but how few would have remembered - or indeed has 
any one ever remembered? - to count the spontaneous lapse of coin 
double also?  Yet there are two of you, each must do his daily 
leakage, and it must be done out of your travelling fund.  You will 
tell me, perhaps, that you carry the coin yourself:  my dear sir, 
do you think you can fool your Maker?  Your wife has to lose her 
quota; and by God she will - if you kept the coin in a belt.  One 
thing I have omitted:  you will lose a certain amount on the 
exchange, but this even I cannot foresee, as it is one of the few 
things that vary with the way a man has. - I am, dear sir, yours 
financially,
</p><p>SAMUEL BUDGETT.

<hr />
<p><b>Letter:  TO ALISON CUNNINGHAM</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>SKERRYVORE, APRIL 16TH, 1887.
</p><p>MY DEAREST CUMMY, - As usual, I have been a dreary bad fellow and 
not written for ages; but you must just try to forgive me, to 
believe (what is the truth) that the number of my letters is no 
measure of the number of times I think of you, and to remember how 
much writing I have to do.  The weather is bright, but still cold; 
and my father, I'm afraid, feels it sharply.  He has had - still 
has, rather - a most obstinate jaundice, which has reduced him 
cruelly in strength, and really upset him altogether.  I hope, or 
think, he is perhaps a little better; but he suffers much, cannot 
sleep at night, and gives John and my mother a severe life of it to 
wait upon him.  My wife is, I think, a little better, but no great 
shakes.  I keep mightily respectable myself.
</p><p>Coolin's Tombstone is now built into the front wall of Skerryvore, 
and poor Bogie's (with a Latin inscription also) is set just above 
it.  Poor, unhappy wee man, he died, as you must have heard, in 
fight, which was what he would have chosen; for military glory was 
more in his line than the domestic virtues.  I believe this is 
about all my news, except that, as I write, there is a blackbird 
singing in our garden trees, as it were at Swanston.  I would like 
fine to go up the burnside a bit, and sit by the pool and be young 
again - or no, be what I am still, only there instead of here, for 
just a little.  Did you see that I had written about John Todd?  In 
this month's LONGMAN it was; if you have not seen it, I will try 
and send it you.  Some day climb as high as Halkerside for me (I am 
never likely to do it for myself), and sprinkle some of the well 
water on the turf.  I am afraid it is a pagan rite, but quite 
harmless, and YE CAN SAIN IT WI' A BIT PRAYER.  Tell the Peewies 
that I mind their forbears well.  My heart is sometimes heavy, and 
sometimes glad to mind it all.  But for what we have received, the 
Lord make us truly thankful.  Don't forget to sprinkle the water, 
and do it in my name; I feel a childish eagerness in this.
</p><p>Remember me most kindly to James, and with all sorts of love to 
yourself, believe me, your laddie,
</p><p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p><p>P.S. - I suppose Mrs. Todd ought to see the paper about her man; 
judge of that, and if you think she would not dislike it, buy her 
one from me, and let me know.  The article is called 'Pastoral,' in 
LONGMAN'S MAGAZINE for April.  I will send you the money; I would 
to-day, but it's the Sabbie day, and I cannae.
</p><p>R. L. S.
</p><p>Remembrances from all here.

<p><b>Letter:  TO SIDNEY COLVIN</b>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>[EDINBURGH, JUNE 1887.]
</p><p>MY DEAR S. C., - At last I can write a word to you.  Your little 
note in the P. M. G. was charming.  I have written four pages in 
the CONTEMPORARY, which Bunting found room for:  they are not very 
good, but I shall do more for his memory in time.
</p><p>About the death, I have long hesitated, I was long before I could 
tell my mind; and now I know it, and can but say that I am glad.  
If we could have had my father, that would have been a different 
thing.  But to keep that changeling - suffering changeling - any 
longer, could better none and nothing.  Now he rests; it is more 
significant, it is more like himself.  He will begin to return to 
us in the course of time, as he was and as we loved him.
</p><p>My favourite words in literature, my favourite scene - 'O let him 
pass,' Kent and Lear - was played for me here in the first moment 
of my return.  I believe Shakespeare saw it with his own father.  I 
had no words; but it was shocking to see.  He died on his feet, you 
know; was on his feet the last day, knowing nobody - still he would 
be up.  This was his constant wish; also that he might smoke a pipe 
on his last day.  The funeral would have pleased him; it was the 
largest private funeral in man's memory here.
</p><p>We have no plans, and it is possible we may go home without going 
through town.  I do not know; I have no views yet whatever; nor can 
have any at this stage of my cold and my business. - Ever yours,
</p><p>R. L. S.
