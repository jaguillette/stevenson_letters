Letter: TO THOMAS STEVENSON

[CHALET AM STEIN, DAVOS, AUTUMN 1881.]
MY DEAR FATHER, - It occurred to me last night in bed that I could write
The Murder of Red Colin, A Story of the Forfeited Estates.
This I have all that is necessary for, with the following exceptions:-
TRIALS OF THE SONS OF ROY ROB WITH ANECDOTES: Edinburgh, 1818, and
The second volume of BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.
You might also look in Arnot's CRIMINAL TRIALS up in my room, and see what observations he has on the case (Trial of James Stewart in Appin for murder of Campbell of Glenure, 1752); if he has none, perhaps you could see - O yes, see if Burton has it in his two vols. of trial stories. I hope he hasn't; but care not; do it over again anyway.
The two named authorities I must see. With these, I could soon pull off this article; and it shall be my first for the electors. - Ever affectionate son,
R. L. S.
