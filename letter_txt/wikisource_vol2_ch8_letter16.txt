Letter: TO MISS RAWLINSON

[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, APRIL 1886.]
OF the many flowers you brought me, Only some were meant to stay, And the flower I thought the sweetest Was the flower that went away.
Of the many flowers you brought me, All were fair and fresh and gay, But the flower I thought the sweetest Was the blossom of the May.
ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
