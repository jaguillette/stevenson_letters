Letter: TO THOMAS STEVENSON

TERMINUS HOTEL, MARSEILLE, LE 17TH OCTOBER 1882.
MY DEAR FATHER, - . . We grow, every time we see it, more delighted with our house. It is five miles out of Marseilles, in a lovely spot, among lovely wooded and cliffy hills - most mountainous in line - far lovelier, to my eyes, than any Alps. To- day we have been out inventorying; and though a mistral blew, it was delightful in an open cab, and our house with the windows open was heavenly, soft, dry, sunny, southern. I fear there are fleas - it is called Campagne Defli - and I look forward to tons of insecticide being employed.
I have had to write a letter to the NEW YORK TRIBUNE and the ATHENAEUM. Payn was accused of stealing my stories! I think I have put things handsomely for him.
Just got a servant!Â !Â ! - Ever affectionate son,
R. L. STEVENSON.
Our servant is a Muckle Hash of a Weedy!
