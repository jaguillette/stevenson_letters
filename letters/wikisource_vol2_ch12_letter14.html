<p><b>Letter: TO JOHN P-N</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, DECEMBER 3RD, 1893.</p>
<p>DEAR JOHNNIE, - Well, I must say you seem to be a tremendous fellow! Before I was eight I used to write stories - or dictate them at least - and I had produced an excellent history of Moses, for which I got 1 pound from an uncle; but I had never gone the length of a play, so you have beaten me fairly on my own ground. I hope you may continue to do so, and thanking you heartily for your nice letter, I shall beg you to believe me yours truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
