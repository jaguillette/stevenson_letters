<p><b>Letter: TO A. ST. GAUDENS</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, SAMOA, JULY 8, 1894.</p>
<p>MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS, - This is to tell you that the medallion has been at last triumphantly transported up the hill and placed over my smoking-room mantelpiece. It is considered by everybody a first-rate but flattering portrait. We have it in a very good light, which brings out the artistic merits of the god-like sculptor to great advantage. As for my own opinion, I believe it to be a speaking likeness, and not flattered at all; possibly a little the reverse. The verses (curse the rhyme) look remarkably well.</p>
<p>Please do not longer delay, but send me an account for the expense of the gilt letters. I was sorry indeed that they proved beyond the means of a small farmer. - Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
