<p>Letter: TO THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[HOTEL BELVEDERE], DAVOS, DECEMBER 12 [1880].</p>
<p>MY DEAR FATHER, - Here is the scheme as well as I can foresee. I begin the book immediately after the '15, as then began the attempt to suppress the Highlands.</p>
<p>I. THIRTY YEARS' INTERVAL</p>
<p>(1) Rob Roy. (2) The Independent Companies: the Watches. (3) Story of Lady Grange. (4) The Military Roads, and Disarmament: Wade and (5) Burt.</p>
<p>II. THE HEROIC AGE</p>
<p>(1) Duncan Forbes of Culloden. (2) Flora Macdonald. (3) The Forfeited Estates; including Hereditary Jurisdictions; and the admirable conduct of the tenants.</p>
<p>III. LITERATURE HERE INTERVENES</p>
<p>(1) The Ossianic Controversy. (2) Boswell and Johnson. (3) Mrs. Grant of Laggan.</p>
<p>IV. ECONOMY</p>
<p>(1) Highland Economics. (2) The Reinstatement of the Proprietors. (3) The Evictions. (4) Emigration. (5) Present State.</p>
<p>V. RELIGION</p>
<p>(1) The Catholics, Episcopals, and Kirk, and Soc. Prop. Christ. Knowledge. (2) The Men. (3) The Disruption.</p>
<p>All this, of course, will greatly change in form, scope, and order; this is just a bird's-eye glance. Thank you for BURT, which came, and for your Union notes. I have read one-half (about 900 pages) of Wodrow's CORRESPONDENCE, with some improvement, but great fatigue. The doctor thinks well of my recovery, which puts me in good hope for the future. I should certainly be able to make a fine history of this.</p>
<p>My Essays are going through the press, and should be out in January or February. - Ever affectionate son,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
