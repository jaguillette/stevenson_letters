<p>Letter: TO HORATIO F. BROWN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>HOTEL BELVEDERE, DAVOS, SPRING 1881.</p>
<p>MY DEAR BROWN, - Nine years I have conded them.</p>
<p>Brave lads in olden musical centuries Sang, night by night, adorable choruses, Sat late by alehouse doors in April Chaunting in joy as the moon was rising:</p>
<p>Moon-seen and merry, under the trellises, Flush-faced they played with old polysyllables; Spring scents inspired, old wine diluted; Love and Apollo were there to chorus.</p>
<p>Now these, the songs, remain to eternity, Those, only those, the bountiful choristers Gone - those are gone, those unremembered Sleep and are silent in earth for ever.</p>
<p>So man himself appears and evanishes, So smiles and goes; as wanderers halting at Some green-embowered house, play their music, Play and are gone on the windy highway;</p>
<p>Yet dwells the strain enshrined in the memory Long after they departed eternally, Forth-faring tow'rd far mountain summits, Cities of men on the sounding Ocean.</p>
<p>Youth sang the song in years immemorial; Brave chanticleer, he sang and was beautiful; Bird-haunted, green tree-tops in springtime Heard and were pleased by the voice of singing;</p>
<p>Youth goes, and leaves behind him a prodigy - Songs sent by thee afar from Venetian Sea-grey lagunes, sea-paven highways, Dear to me here in my Alpine exile.</p>
<p>Please, my dear Brown, forgive my horrid delay. Symonds overworked and knocked up. I off my sleep; my wife gone to Paris. Weather lovely. - Yours ever,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>Monte Generoso in May; here, I think, till the end of April; write again, to prove you are forgiving.</p>
