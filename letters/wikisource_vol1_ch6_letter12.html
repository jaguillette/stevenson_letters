<p>Letter: TO MR. AND MRS. THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>CHALET SOLITUDE, MAY 5, [1883].</p>
<p>MY DEAREST PEOPLE, - I have had a great piece of news. There has been offered for TREASURE ISLAND - how much do you suppose? I believe it would be an excellent jest to keep the answer till my next letter. For two cents I would do so. Shall I? Anyway, I'll turn the page first. No - well - A hundred pounds, all alive, O! A hundred jingling, tingling, golden, minted quid. Is not this wonderful? Add that I have now finished, in draft, the fifteenth chapter of my novel, and have only five before me, and you will see what cause of gratitude I have.</p>
<p>The weather, to look at the per contra sheet, continues vomitable; and Fanny is quite out of sorts. But, really, with such cause of gladness, I have not the heart to be dispirited by anything. My child's verse book is finished, dedication and all, and out of my hands - you may tell Cummy; SILVERADO is done, too, and cast upon the waters; and this novel so near completion, it does look as if I should support myself without trouble in the future. If I have only health, I can, I thank God. It is dreadful to be a great, big man, and not be able to buy bread.</p>
<p>O that this may last!</p>
<p>I have to-day paid my rent for the half year, till the middle of September, and got my lease: why they have been so long, I know not.</p>
<p>I wish you all sorts of good things.</p>
<p>When is our marriage day? - Your loving and ecstatic son,</p>
<p>TREESURE EILAAN,</p>
<p>It has been for me a Treasure Island verily.</p>
