<p>Letter: TO THOMAS STEVENSON</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>TERMINUS HOTEL, MARSEILLE, LE 17TH OCTOBER 1882.</p>
<p>MY DEAR FATHER, - . . We grow, every time we see it, more delighted with our house. It is five miles out of Marseilles, in a lovely spot, among lovely wooded and cliffy hills - most mountainous in line - far lovelier, to my eyes, than any Alps. To- day we have been out inventorying; and though a mistral blew, it was delightful in an open cab, and our house with the windows open was heavenly, soft, dry, sunny, southern. I fear there are fleas - it is called Campagne Defli - and I look forward to tons of insecticide being employed.</p>
<p>I have had to write a letter to the NEW YORK TRIBUNE and the ATHENAEUM. Payn was accused of stealing my stories! I think I have put things handsomely for him.</p>
<p>Just got a servant! ! ! - Ever affectionate son,</p>
<p>R. L. STEVENSON.</p>
<p>Our servant is a Muckle Hash of a Weedy!</p>
