<p><b>Letter: TO CHARLES SCRIBNER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[SARANAC, NOVEMBER 20 OR 21, 1887.]</p>
<p>MY DEAR MR. SCRIBNER, - Heaven help me, I am under a curse just now. I have played fast and loose with what I said to you; and that, I beg you to believe, in the purest innocence of mind. I told you you should have the power over all my work in this country; and about a fortnight ago, when M'Clure was here, I calmly signed a bargain for the serial publication of a story. You will scarce believe that I did this in mere oblivion; but I did; and all that I can say is that I will do so no more, and ask you to forgive me. Please write to me soon as to this.</p>
<p>Will you oblige me by paying in for three articles, as already sent, to my account with John Paton &amp; Co., 52 William Street? This will be most convenient for us.</p>
<p>The fourth article is nearly done; and I am the more deceived, or it is A BUSTER.</p>
<p>Now as to the first thing in this letter, I do wish to hear from you soon; and I am prepared to hear any reproach, or (what is harder to hear) any forgiveness; for I have deserved the worst. - Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
