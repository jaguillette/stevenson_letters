<p><b>Letter: TO CHARLES BAXTER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>SARANAC, 18TH NOVEMBER 1887.</p>
<p>MY DEAR CHARLES, - No likely I'm going to waste a sheet of paper. . . . I am offered 1600 pounds ($8000) for the American serial rights on my next story! As you say, times are changed since the Lothian Road. Well, the Lothian Road was grand fun too; I could take an afternoon of it with great delight. But I'm awfu' grand noo, and long may it last!</p>
<p>Remember me to any of the faithful - if there are any left. I wish I could have a crack with you. - Yours ever affectionately,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
<p>I find I have forgotten more than I remembered of business. . . . Please let us know (if you know) for how much Skerryvore is let; you will here detect the female mind; I let it for what I could get; nor shall the possession of this knowledge (which I am happy to have forgot) increase the amount by so much as the shadow of a sixpenny piece; but my females are agog. - Yours ever,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
