<p><b>Letter: TO MRS. A. BAKER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>DECEMBER 1893.</p>
<p>DEAR MADAM, - There is no trouble, and I wish I could help instead. As it is, I fear I am only going to put you to trouble and vexation. This Braille writing is a kind of consecration, and I would like if I could to have your copy perfect. The two volumes are to be published as Vols. I. and II. of THE ADVENTURES OF DAVID BALFOUR. 1st, KIDNAPPED; 2nd, CATRIONA. I am just sending home a corrected KIDNAPPED for this purpose to Messrs. Cassell, and in order that I may if possible be in time, I send it to you first of all. Please, as soon as you have noted the changes, forward the same to Cassell and Co., La Belle Sauvage Yard, Ludgate Hill.</p>
<p>I am writing to them by this mail to send you CATRIONA.</p>
<p>You say, dear madam, you are good enough to say, it is 'a keen pleasure' to you to bring my book within the reach of the blind.</p>
<p>Conceive then what it is to me! and believe me, sincerely yours,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>I was a barren tree before, I blew a quenched coal, I could not, on their midnight shore, The lonely blind console.</p>
<p>A moment, lend your hand, I bring My sheaf for you to bind, And you can teach my words to sing In the darkness of the blind.</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
