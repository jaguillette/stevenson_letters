<p>SKERRYVORE, SEPTEMBER 4, 1886.</p>
<p>NOT roses to the rose, I trow, The thistle sends, nor to the bee Do wasps bring honey. Wherefore now Should Locker ask a verse from me?</p>
<p>Martial, perchance, - but he is dead, And Herrick now must rhyme no more; Still burning with the muse, they tread (And arm in arm) the shadowy shore.</p>
<p>They, if they lived, with dainty hand, To music as of mountain brooks, Might bring you worthy words to stand Unshamed, dear Locker, in your books.</p>
<p>But tho' these fathers of your race Be gone before, yourself a sire, To-day you see before your face Your stalwart youngsters touch the lyre -</p>
<p>On these - on Lang, or Dobson - call, Long leaders of the songful feast. They lend a verse your laughing fall - A verse they owe you at the least.</p>
