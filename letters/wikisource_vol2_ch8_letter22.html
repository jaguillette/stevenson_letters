<p><b>Letter: TO CHARLES BAXTER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>[SKERRYVORE, BOURNEMOUTH, JULY 1886].</p>
<p>DEAR CHARLES, - Doubtless, if all goes well, towards the 1st of August we shall be begging at your door. Thanks for a sight of the papers, which I return (you see) at once, fearing further responsibility.</p>
<p>Glad you like Dauvit; but eh, man, yon's terrible strange conduc' o' thon man Rankeillor. Ca' him a legal adviser! It would make a bonny law-shuit, the Shaws case; and yon paper they signed, I'm thinking, wouldnae be muckle thought o' by Puggy Deas. - Yours ever,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
