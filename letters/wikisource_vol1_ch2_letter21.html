<p>Letter: TO SIDNEY COLVIN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>FEBRUARY 8, 1875.</p>
<p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - Forgive my bothering you. Here is the proof of my second KNOX. Glance it over, like a good fellow, and if there's anything very flagrant send it to me marked. I have no confidence in myself; I feel such an ass. What have I been doing? As near as I can calculate, nothing. And yet I have worked all this month from three to five hours a day, that is to say, from one to three hours more than my doctor allows me; positively no result.</p>
<p>No, I can write no article just now; I am PIOCHING, like a madman, at my stories, and can make nothing of them; my simplicity is tame and dull - my passion tinsel, boyish, hysterical. Never mind - ten years hence, if I live, I shall have learned, so help me God. I know one must work, in the meantime (so says Balzac) COMME LE MINEUR ENFOUI SOUS UN EBOULEMENT.</p>
<p>J'Y PARVIENDRAI, NOM DE NOM DE NOM! But it's a long look forward. - Ever yours,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
