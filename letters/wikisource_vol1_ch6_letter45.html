<p>Letter: TO MISS FERRIER</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, VAR, [MARCH 22, 1884].</p>
<p>MY DEAR MISS FERRIER, - Are you really going to fall us? This seems a dreadful thing. My poor wife, who is not well off for friends on this bare coast, has been promising herself, and I have been promising her, a rare acquisition. And now Miss Burn has failed, and you utter a very doubtful note. You do not know how delightful this place is, nor how anxious we are for a visit. Look at the names: 'The Solitude' - is that romantic? The palm-trees? - how is that for the gorgeous East? 'Var'? the name of a river - 'the quiet waters by'! 'Tis true, they are in another department, and consist of stones and a biennial spate; but what a music, what a plash of brooks, for the imagination! We have hills; we have skies; the roses are putting forth, as yet sparsely; the meadows by the sea are one sheet of jonquils; the birds sing as in an English May - for, considering we are in France and serve up our song- birds, I am ashamed to say, on a little field of toast and with a sprig of thyme (my own receipt) in their most innocent and now unvocal bellies - considering all this, we have a wonderfully fair wood-music round this Solitude of ours. What can I say more? - All this awaits you. KENNST DU DAS LAND, in short. - Your sincere friend,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
