<p><b>Letter: TO FRED ORR</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>VAILIMA, UPOLU, SAMOA, NOVEMBER 28TH, 1891.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, - Your obliging communication is to hand. I am glad to find that you have read some of my books, and to see that you spell my name right. This is a point (for some reason) of great difficulty; and I believe that a gentleman who can spell Stevenson with a v at sixteen, should have a show for the Presidency before fifty. By that time</p>
<p><br>
I, nearer to the wayside inn,</p>
<p><br>
predict that you will have outgrown your taste for autographs, but perhaps your son may have inherited the collection, and on the morning of the great day will recall my prophecy to your mind. And in the papers of 1921 (say) this letter may arouse a smile.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, read something else besides novels and newspapers; the first are good enough when they are good; the second, at their best, are worth nothing. Read great books of literature and history; try to understand the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages; be sure you do not understand when you dislike them; condemnation is non-comprehension. And if you know something of these two periods, you will know a little more about to-day, and may be a good President.</p>
<p>I send you my best wishes, and am yours,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON,</p>
<p>AUTHOR OF A VAST QUANTITY OF LITTLE BOOKS.</p>
