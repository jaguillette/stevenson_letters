<p><b>Letter: TO CHARLES BAXTER</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1ST DEC. '92.</p>
<p>. . . I have a novel on the stocks to be called THE JUSTICE-CLERK. It is pretty Scotch, the Grand Premier is taken from Braxfield - (Oh, by the by, send me Cockburn's MEMORIALS) - and some of the story is - well - queer. The heroine is seduced by one man, and finally disappears with the other man who shot him. . . . Mind you, I expect the JUSTICE-CLERK to be my masterpiece. My Braxfield is already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever, and so far as he has gone FAR my best character.</p>
<p>[LATER.]</p>
<p>Second thought. I wish Pitcairn's CRIMINAL TRIALS QUAM PRIMUM. Also, an absolutely correct text of the Scots judiciary oath.</p>
<p>Also, in case Pitcairn does not come down late enough, I wish as full a report as possible of a Scotch murder trial between 1790- 1820. Understand, THE FULLEST POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>Is there any book which would guide me as to the following facts?</p>
<p>The Justice-Clerk tries some people capitally on circuit. Certain evidence cropping up, the charge is transferred to the J.-C.'s own son. Of course, in the next trial the J.-C. is excluded, and the case is called before the Lord-Justice General.</p>
<p>Where would this trial have to be? I fear in Edinburgh, which would not suit my view. Could it be again at the circuit town?</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
