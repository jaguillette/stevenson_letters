<p>Letter: TO DR. ALEXANDER JAPP</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BRAEMAR, 1881.</p>
<p>MY DEAR DR. JAPP, - My father has gone, but I think may take it upon me to ask you to keep the book. Of all things you could do to endear yourself to me, you have done the best, for my father and you have taken a fancy to each other.</p>
<p>I do not know how to thank you for all your kind trouble in the matter of 'The Sea-Cook,' but I am not unmindful. My health is still poorly, and I have added intercostal rheumatism - a new attraction - which sewed me up nearly double for two days, and still gives me a list to starboard - let us be ever nautical!</p>
<p>I do not think with the start I have there will be any difficulty in letting Mr. Henderson go ahead whenever he likes. I will write my story up to its legitimate conclusion; and then we shall be in a position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable, and I would then myself know better about its practicability from the story- teller's point of view. - Yours ever very sincerely,</p>
<p>R. L. STEVENSON.</p>
