<p><b>Letter: TO MISS ADELAIDE BOODLE</b></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>BOURNEMOUTH, AUGUST 19TH, 1887.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE, - I promise you the paper-knife shall go to sea with me; and if it were in my disposal, I should promise it should return with me too. All that you say, I thank you for very much; I thank you for all the pleasantness that you have brought about our house; and I hope the day may come when I shall see you again in poor old Skerryvore, now left to the natives of Canada, or to worse barbarians, if such exist. I am afraid my attempt to jest is rather A CONTRE-COEUR. Good-bye - AU REVOIR - and do not forget your friend,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
