<p>Letter: TO SIDNEY COLVIN</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>608 BUSH STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, [MARCH 1880].</p>
<p>MY DEAR COLVIN, - My landlord and landlady's little four-year-old child is dying in the house; and O, what he has suffered. It has really affected my health. O never, never any family for me! I am cured of that.</p>
<p>I have taken a long holiday - have not worked for three days, and will not for a week; for I was really weary. Excuse this scratch; for the child weighs on me, dear Colvin. I did all I could to help; but all seems little, to the point of crime, when one of these poor innocents lies in such misery. - Ever yours,</p>
<p>R. L. S.</p>
