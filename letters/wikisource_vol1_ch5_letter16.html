<p>Letter: TO PROFESSOR AENEAS MACKAY</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>KINNAIRD COTTAGE, PITLOCHRY, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 21, 1881.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MACKAY, - What is this I hear? - that you are retiring from your chair. It is not, I hope, from ill-health?</p>
<p>But if you are retiring, may I ask if you have promised your support to any successor? I have a great mind to try. The summer session would suit me; the chair would suit me - if only I would suit it; I certainly should work it hard: that I can promise. I only wish it were a few years from now, when I hope to have something more substantial to show for myself. Up to the present time, all that I have published, even bordering on history, has been in an occasional form, and I fear this is much against me.</p>
<p>Please let me hear a word in answer, and believe me, yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
