<p>Letter: TO W. E. HENLEY</p>

<p>LA SOLITUDE, HYERES-LES-PALMIERS, MAY 1883.</p>
<p>MY DEAR LAD, - The books came some time since, but I have not had the pluck to answer: a shower of small troubles having fallen in, or troubles that may be very large.</p>
<p>I have had to incur a huge vague debt for cleaning sewers; our house was (of course) riddled with hidden cesspools, but that was infallible. I have the fever, and feel the duty to work very heavy on me at times; yet go it must. I have had to leave FONTAINEBLEAU, when three hours would finish it, and go full-tilt at tushery for a while. But it will come soon.</p>
<p>I think I can give you a good article on Hokusai; but that is for afterwards; FONTAINEBLEAU is first in hand</p>
<p>By the way, my view is to give the PENNY WHISTLES to Crane or Greenaway. But Crane, I think, is likeliest; he is a fellow who, at least, always does his best.</p>
<p>Shall I ever have money enough to write a play? O dire necessity!</p>
<p>A word in your ear: I don't like trying to support myself. I hate the strain and the anxiety; and when unexpected expenses are foisted on me, I feel the world is playing with false dice. - Now I must Tush, adieu,</p>
<p>AN ACHING, FEVERED, PENNY-JOURNALIST.</p>
<p>A lytle Jape of TUSHERIE.</p>
<p>By A. Tusher.</p>
<p>The pleasant river gushes Among the meadows green; At home the author tushes; For him it flows unseen.</p>
<p>The Birds among the Bushes May wanton on the spray; But vain for him who tushes The brightness of the day!</p>
<p>The frog among the rushes Sits singing in the blue. By'r la'kin! but these tushes Are wearisome to do!</p>
<p>The task entirely crushes The spirit of the bard: God pity him who tushes - His task is very hard.</p>
<p>The filthy gutter slushes, The clouds are full of rain, But doomed is he who tushes To tush and tush again.</p>
<p>At morn with his hair-brUshes, Still, 'tush' he says, and weeps; At night again he tushes, And tushes till he sleeps.</p>
<p>And when at length he pushes Beyond the river dark - 'Las, to the man who tushes, 'Tush' shall be God's remark!</p>
