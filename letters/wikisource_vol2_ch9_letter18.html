<p><b>Letter: TO E. L. BURLINGAME</b></p>

<p>SARANAC, NOVEMBER 1887.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME, - The revise seemed all right, so I did not trouble you with it; indeed, my demand for one was theatrical, to impress that obdurate dog, your reader. Herewith a third paper: it has been a cruel long time upon the road, but here it is, and not bad at last, I fondly hope. I was glad you liked the LANTERN BEARERS; I did, too. I thought it was a good paper, really contained some excellent sense, and was ingeniously put together. I have not often had more trouble than I have with these papers; thirty or forty pages of foul copy, twenty is the very least I have had. Well, you pay high; it is fit that I should have to work hard, it somewhat quiets my conscience. - Yours very truly,</p>
<p>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
